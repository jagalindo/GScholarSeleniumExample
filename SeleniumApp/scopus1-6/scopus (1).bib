abstract={A software product line (SPL) is a set of software systems that have a particular set of common features and that satisfy the needs of a particular market segment or mission. Feature modeling is one of the key activities involved in the design of SPLs. The feature diagram produced in this activity captures the commonalities and variabilities of SPLs. In some complex domains (e.g.; ubiquitous computing, autonomic systems and context-aware computing), it is difficult to foresee all functionalities and variabilities a specific SPL may require. Thus, Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPLs) bind variation points at runtime to adapt to fluctuations in user needs as well as to adapt to changes in the environment. In this context, relying on formal representations of feature models is important to allow them to be automatically analyzed during system execution. Among the mechanisms used for representing and analyzing feature models, description logic (DL) based approaches demand to be better investigated in DSPLs since it provides capabilities, such as automated inconsistency detection, reasoning efficiency, scalability and expressivity. Ontology is the most common way to represent feature models knowledge based on DL reasoners. Previous works conceived ontologies for feature modeling either based on OWL classes and properties or based on OWL individuals. However, considering change or evolution scenarios of feature models, we need to compare whether a class-based or an individual-based feature modeling style is recommended to describe feature models to support SPLs, and especially its capabilities to deal with changes in feature models, as required by DSPLs. In this paper, we conduct a controlled experiment to empirically compare two approaches based on each one of these modeling styles in several changing scenarios (e.g.; add/remove mandatory feature, add/remove optional feature and so on). We measure time to perform changes, structural impact of changes (flexibility) and correctness for performing changes in our experiment. Our results indicate that using OWL individuals requires less time to change and is more flexible than using OWL classes and properties. These results provide insightful assumptions towards the definition of an approach relying on reasoning capabilities of ontologies that can effectively support products reconfiguration in the context of DSPL. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={As an important research issue in software product line, feature selection is extensively studied. Besides the basic functional requirements (FRs), the non-functional requirements (NFRs) are also critical during feature selection. Some NFRs have numerical constraints, while some have not. Without clear criteria, the latter are always expected to be the best possible. However, most existing selection methods ignore the combination of constrained and unconstrained NFRs and FRs. Meanwhile, the complex constraints and dependencies among features are perpetual challenges for feature selection. To this end, this paper proposes a multi-objective optimization algorithm IVEA to optimize the selection of features with NFRs and FRs by considering the relations among these features. Particularly, we first propose a two-dimensional fitness function. One dimension is to optimize the NFRs without quantitative constraints. The other one is to assure the selected features satisfy the FRs, and conform to the relations among features. Second, we propose a violation-dominance principle, which guides the optimization under FRs and the relations among features. We conducted comprehensive experiments on two feature models with different sizes to evaluate IVEA with state-of-the-art multi-objective optimization algorithms, including IBEAHD, IBEA<inf>ε+</inf>, NSGA-II and SPEA2. The results showed that the IVEA significantly outperforms the above baselines in the NFRs optimization. Meanwhile, our algorithm needs less time to generate a solution that meets the FRs and the constraints on NFRs and fully conforms to the feature model. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Cost-effective testing of a product in a product line requires obtaining a set of relevant test cases from the entire test suite via test selection and minimization techniques. In this paper, we particularly focus on test minimization for product lines, which identifies and eliminates redundant test cases from test suites in order to reduce the total number of test cases to execute, thereby improving the efficiency of testing. However, such minimization may result in the minimized test suite with low test coverage, low fault revealing capability, low priority test cases, and require more time than the allowed testing budget (e.g., time) as compared to the original test suite. To deal with the above issues, we formulated the minimization problem as a search problem and defined a fitness function considering various optimization objectives based on the above issues. To assess the performance of our fitness function, we conducted an extensive empirical evaluation by investigating the fitness function with three weight-based Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and seven multi-objective search algorithms using an industrial case study and 500 artificial problems inspired from the industrial case study. The results show that Random-Weighted Genetic Algorithm (RWGA) significantly outperforms the other algorithms since RWGA can balance all the objectives together by dynamically updating weights during each generation.

abstract={Context Increase in market competition is one of the main reasons for developing and maintaining families of systems, termed Product Lines (PLs). Managing those PLs is challenging, let alone the management of several related PLs. Currently, those PLs are managed separately or their relations are analyzed assuming explicit specification of dependencies or use of an underlying terminology. Such assumptions may not hold when developing the PLs in different departments or companies applying various engineering processes. Objective In this work we call for utilizing the knowledge gained from developing and maintaining different PLs in the same domain in order to recommend on improvements to the management of PLs. Method The suggested approach conducts domain knowledge extraction and cross PL analysis on feature diagrams - the main aid for modeling PL variability. The domain knowledge is extracted by applying similarity metrics, clustering, and mining techniques. Based on the created domain models, the approach performs cross PL analysis that examines relations in the domain models and generates improvement recommendations to existing PLs and overall management recommendations (e.g., merging or splitting PLs). Results The approach outcomes were evaluated by humans in a domain of mobile phones. The evaluation results may provide evidence that the outcomes of the approach in general and its recommendations in particular meet human perception of the given domain. Conclusion We conclude that through domain knowledge extraction and cross PL analysis the suggested approach may generate recommendations useful to the management of individual PLs, as well as to the overall management of different PLs in the same domain. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPL) are a well-accepted approach to manage runtime variability, by means of late binding the variation points at runtime.

We evaluate six existing MOEAs by applying them to 12 different FMs, optimizing three different objectives (usability, battery consumption and memory footprint).

abstract={Within product lines, collections of several related products are defined through their commonalities in terms of features rather than specifying them individually one-by-one. In this paper we present a compositional framework for modeling dynamic product lines by a statebased formalism with both probabilistic and nondeterministic behaviors. Rules for feature changes in products made during runtime are formalized by a coordination component imposing constraints on possible feature activations and deactivations. Our framework supports large-scaled product lines described through multi-features, i.e., where products may involve multiple instances of a feature. To establish temporal properties for products in a product line, verification techniques have to face a combinatorial blow-up that arises when reasoning about several feature combinations. This blow-up can be avoided by family-based approaches exploiting common feature behaviors. We adapt such approaches to our framework, allowing for a quantitative analysis in terms of probabilistic model checking to reason, e.g., about energy and memory consumption, monetary costs, or the reliability of products. Our framework can also be used to compute strategies how to trigger feature changes for optimizing quantitative objectives using probabilistic model-checking techniques. We present a natural and conceptually simple translation of product lines into the input language of the prominent probabilistic model checker Prism and show feasibility of this translation within a case study on an energy-aware server platform product line comprising thousands of products. To cope with the arising complexity, we follow the family-based analysis scheme and apply symbolic methods for a compact state-space representation. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.},

abstract={Context Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE) is an emerging discipline that focuses on the application of search-based optimization techniques to software engineering problems. Software Product Lines (SPLs) are families of related software systems whose members are distinguished by the set of features each one provides. SPL development practices have proven benefits such as improved software reuse, better customization, and faster time to market. A typical SPL usually involves a large number of systems and features, a fact that makes them attractive for the application of SBSE techniques which are able to tackle problems that involve large search spaces. Objective The main objective of our work is to identify the quantity and the type of research on the application of SBSE techniques to SPL problems. More concretely, the SBSE techniques that have been used and at what stage of the SPL life cycle, the type of case studies employed and their empirical analysis, and the fora where the research has been published. Method A systematic mapping study was conducted with five research questions and assessed 77 publications from 2001, when the term SBSE was coined, until 2014. Results The most common application of SBSE techniques found was testing followed by product configuration, with genetic algorithms and multi-objective evolutionary algorithms being the two most commonly used techniques. Our study identified the need to improve the robustness of the empirical evaluation of existing research, a lack of extensive and robust tool support, and multiple avenues worthy of further investigation. Conclusions Our study attested the great synergy existing between both fields, corroborated the increasing and ongoing interest in research on the subject, and revealed challenging open research questions. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Variability determines the capability of software applications to be configured and customized. A common need during the development of variability-intensive systems is the automated analysis of their underlying variability models, for example, detecting contradictory configuration options. The analysis operations that are performed on variability models are often very complex, which hinders the testing of the corresponding analysis tools and makes difficult, often infeasible, to determine the correctness of their outputs, that is, the well-known oracle problem in software testing. In this article, we present a generic approach for the automated detection of faults in variability analysis tools overcoming the oracle problem. Our work enables the generation of random variability models together with the exact set of valid configurations represented by these models. These test data are generated from scratch using stepwise transformations and assuring that certain constraints (a.k.a. metamorphic relations) hold at each step. To show the feasibility and generalizability of our approach, it has been used to automatically test several analysis tools in three variability domains: feature models, common upgradeability description format documents and Boolean formulas. Among other results, we detected 19 real bugs in 7 out of the 15 tools under test. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={While standardization has empowered the software industry to substantially scale software development and to provide affordable software to a broad market, it often does not address smaller market segments, nor the needs and wishes of individual customers. Software product lines reconcile mass production and standardization with mass customization in software engineering. Ideally, based on a set of reusable parts, a software manufacturer can generate a software product based on the requirements of its customer. The concept of features is central to achieving this level of automation, because features bridge the gap between the requirements the customer has and the functionality a product provides. Thus features are a central concept in all phases of product-line development. The authors take a developer's viewpoint, focus on the development, maintenance, and implementation of product-line variability, and especially concentrate on automated product derivation based on a user's feature selection. The book consists of three parts. Part I provides a general introduction to feature-oriented software product lines, describing the product-line approach and introducing the product-line development process with its two elements of domain and application engineering. The pivotal part II covers a wide variety of implementation techniques including design patterns, frameworks, components, feature-oriented programming, and aspect-oriented programming, as well as tool-based approaches including preprocessors, build systems, version-control systems, and virtual separation of concerns. Finally, part III is devoted to advanced topics related to feature-oriented product lines like refactoring, feature interaction, and analysis tools specific to product lines. In addition, an appendix lists various helpful tools for software product-line development, along with a description of how they relate to the topics covered in this book. To tie the book together, the authors use two running examples that are well documented in the product-line literature: data management for embedded systems, and variations of graph data structures. They start every chapter by explicitly stating the respective learning goals and finish it with a set of exercises; additional teaching material is also available online. All these features make the book ideally suited for teaching - both for academic classes and for professionals interested in self-study. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.

abstract={Large Software Product Lines (SPLs) are common in industry, thus introducing the need of practical solutions to test them. To this end, t-wise can help to drastically reduce the number of product configurations to test. Current t-wise approaches for SPLs are restricted to small values of t. In addition, these techniques fail at providing means to finely control the configuration process. In view of this, means for automatically generating and prioritizing product configurations for large SPLs are required. This paper proposes (a) a search-based approach capable of generating product configurations for large SPLs, forming a scalable and flexible alternative to current techniques and (b) prioritization algorithms for any set of product configurations. Both these techniques employ a similarity heuristic. The ability of the proposed techniques is assessed in an empirical study through a comparison with state of the art tools. The comparison focuses on both the product configuration generation and the prioritization aspects. The results demonstrate that existing t-wise tools and prioritization techniques fail to handle large SPLs. On the contrary, the proposed techniques are both effective and scalable. Additionally, the experiments show that the similarity heuristic can be used as a viable alternative to t-wise. © 1976-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={A feature model is a compact representation of the products of a software product line. The automated extraction of information from feature models is a thriving topic involving numerous analysis operations, techniques and tools. Performance evaluations in this domain mainly rely on the use of random feature models. However, these only provide a rough idea of the behaviour of the tools with average problems and are not sufficient to reveal their real strengths and weaknesses. In this article, we propose to model the problem of finding computationally hard feature models as an optimization problem and we solve it using a novel evolutionary algorithm for optimized feature models (ETHOM). Given a tool and an analysis operation, ETHOM generates input models of a predefined size maximizing aspects such as the execution time or the memory consumption of the tool when performing the operation over the model. This allows users and developers to know the performance of tools in pessimistic cases providing a better idea of their real power and revealing performance bugs. Experiments using ETHOM on a number of analyses and tools have successfully identified models producing much longer executions times and higher memory consumption than those obtained with random models of identical or even larger size. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Over the last two decades, software product lines have been used successfully in industry for building families of systems of related products, maximizing reuse, and exploiting their variable and configurable options. In a changing world, modern software demands more and more adaptive features, many of them performed dynamically, and the requirements on the software architecture to support adaptation capabilities of systems are increasing in importance. Today, many embedded system families and application domains such as ecosystems, service-based applications, and self-adaptive systems demand runtime capabilities for flexible adaptation, reconfiguration, and post-deployment activities. However, as traditional software product line architectures fail to provide mechanisms for runtime adaptation and behavior of products, there is a shift toward designing more dynamic software architectures and building more adaptable software able to handle autonomous decision-making, according to varying conditions. Recent development approaches such as Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPLs) attempt to face the challenges of the dynamic conditions of such systems but the state of these solution architectures is still immature. In order to provide a more comprehensive treatment of DSPL models and their solution architectures, in this research work we provide an overview of the state of the art and current techniques that, partially, attempt to face the many challenges of runtime variability mechanisms in the context of Dynamic Software Product Lines. We also provide an integrated view of the challenges and solutions that are necessary to support runtime variability mechanisms in DSPL models and software architectures. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

Software product lines are intended to be used in a long period of time. As a result, they evolve over time, due to the changes in the requirements. Having several individual products in a software family, verification of the entire family may take a considerable effort. In this paper we aim to decrease this cost by reducing the number of verified products using static analysis techniques. Furthermore, to reduce model checking costs after product line evolution, we restrict the number of products that should be re-verified by reusing the previous verification result. All proposed techniques are based on static analysis of the product family model with respect to the property and can be automated. To show the effectiveness of these techniques we apply them on a set of case studies and present the results. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Software product lines (SPLs) and software ecosystems (SECOs) are approaches to capturing families of closely related software systems in terms of common and variable functionality. SPLs and especially SECOs are subject to evolution to adapt to new or changed requirements resulting in different versions of the software family and its variable assets. These versions may have to be maintained and used for products even after they were superseded by newer versions. Variability models describing valid combinations of variable assets, such as feature models, capture variability in space (configuration), but not variability in time (evolution) making it impossible to respect versions of variable assets in product definitions on a conceptual level. In this paper, we propose Hyper Feature Models (HFMs) explicitly providing feature versions as configurable units for product definition. Furthermore, we provide a version-aware constraint language to specify dependencies between features and ranges of feature versions as well as a procedure to automatically select valid combinations of versions for a pre-configuration of features. We demonstrate our approach in a case study. © 2014 ACM.},

abstract={Variability testing techniques search for effective but manageable test suites that lead to the rapid detection of faults in systems with high variability. Evaluating the effectiveness of these techniques in real settings is a must but challenging due to the lack of variability-intensive systems with available code, automated tests and fault reports. In this paper, we propose using the Drupal framework as a case study to evaluate variability testing techniques. First, we represent the framework variability as a feature model. Then, we report on extensive data extracted from the Drupal git repository and the Drupal issue tracking system. Among other results, we identified 378 faults in single features and 11 faults triggered by the interaction between two of the features of Drupal v7.23, reported during a one-year period. These data may give a new insight into the distribution of faults in variability-intensive systems and the fault propensity of features. To show the feasibility of our work, we used the case study to evaluate the effectiveness of a history-based test case prioritization criterion. Results suggest that this technique could contribute to accelerate the detection of faults of test suites based on combinatorial testing. © 2014 ACM.},

abstract={Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPLs) implement features of a product family, from which products can be derived and reconfigured at runtime. This way, systems can alternate their configurations without service interruption. The activation and deactivation of features at runtime pose challenges for the implementation of a DSPL, in particular for handling object states such as runtime changes to object-scoped variables, their value assignments, and the variable properties. To quantify the complexity of this object migration, we propose a systematic code-level measurement approach which harvests feature implementations and the corresponding variability models for code introductions responsible for critical changes to object states. We have applied our measurement process tentatively to data sets representing 9 SPLs implemented using Fuji. This way, we arrived at first insights on object-migration complexity in SPLs. For example, we observed that the number of feature-specific object states is distributed very unequally in Fuji SPLs, with a few objects having an overly complex map of potential object states and the majority of objects potentially seeing transitions between 1 and 5 object states. We also evaluated different tactics of applying SAT solvers to analyze variability models in this context. © 2014 ACM.},

While comparators present similarities and differences between competing products, configurators propose an assisted environment to gradually choose and customize products. The two systems have pros and cons and are inherently different. But both share the same variability information background and operate over a set of (possible) products, typically represented through product comparison matrices (PCMs). A key issue is that current PCMs have no clear semantics, making their analysis and transformations imprecise and hard. In this paper, we sketch a research plan for generating dedicated comparators or configurators from PCMs. The core of our vision is the use of formal variability models to encode PCMs and enables a further exploitation by developers of comparators or configurators.

abstract={In the area of Software Product Lines(SPL), most of the research work focuses on automated analysis of SPLs and the traceability relation between the problem domain and solution domain. An SPL with few features can generate billions of products; to analyze such a large product space, we need efficient analysis operations. For a given specification, we can get many possible implementations; choosing one implementation from this is a non-trivial task. In this paper, we extend the work on analyzing software product lines to propose a cost effective approach that fetches products from a given SPL based on various factors. When there are multiple implementations for a given specification, then it is the cost factors which determine the product selection. To this end, we propose a revised formal framework for SPLs with cost factors. This approach has been implemented in a tool SPLANE-CF (SPL Analysis Engine with Cost Factors). We illustrate the efficiency of SPLANE-CF on a fairly large size case study. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract={Feature models are a common way to represent variability requirements of software product lines by expressing the set of feature combinations that software products can have. Assuring quality of feature models is thus of paramount importance for assuring quality in software product line engineering. However, feature models can have several types of defects that disminish benefits of software product line engineering.Two of such defects are dead features and false optional features. Several state-of-the-art techniques identify these defects, but only few of them tackle the problem of identifying their causes. Besides, the explanations they provide are cumbersome and hard to understand by humans. In this paper, we propose an ontological rule-based approach to: (a) identify dead and false optional features; (b)identify certain causes of these defects; and (c) explain these causes in natural language helping modelers to correct found defects. We represent our approach with a feature model taken from literature. A preliminary empirical evaluation of our approach over 31 FMs shows that our proposal is effective, accurate and scalable to 150 features. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Feature Models (FMs) are a notation to represent differences and commonalities between products derived from a product line. However, product line modelers could unintentionally incorporate dead features in FMs. A dead feature is a type of defect, which implies that one or more features are not present in any product of the product line. Some authors have used ontologies in product lines, but they have not exploited ontology reasoning to identify and explain causes for defects in FMs in natural language. In this paper, we propose an ontology that represents FMs in OWL (Web Ontology Language). Then, we use SQWRL (Semantic Query-enhanced Web Rule Language) to identify dead features in a FM and identify and explain certain causes of this defect in natural language. Our preliminary empirical evaluation confrms the benefts of our approach.},

The store has a huge input space where customers can place almost three millions of different orders which made testing an extremely difficult task. To address the challenge, we explored the applicability of some of the practices for variability management in software product lines. First, we used a feature model to represent the store input space which provided us with a variability view easy to understand, share and discuss with all the stakeholders. Second, we used techniques for the automated analysis of feature models for the detection and repair of inconsistent and missing configuration settings. Finally, we used test selection and prioritization techniques for the generation of a manageable and effective set of test cases. Our findings, summarized in a set of lessons learnt, suggest that variability techniques could successfully address many of the challenges found when developing e-commerce sites. © 2014 ACM.},

Various works have addressed edits to fms for fm evolution and tool support to ensure consistency of fms. An important extension to fms are feature cardinalities and related constraints, as extensively used e.g., when modeling variability of cloud computing environments. Since cardinality-based fms pose additional complexity, additional support for evolution and consistency checking with respect to feature cardinalities would be desirable, but has not been addressed yet. In this paper, we discuss common cardinality-based fm edits and resulting inconsistencies based on experiences with fms in cloud domain. We introduce tool-support for automated inconsistency detection and explanation based on an off-the-shelf solver. We demonstrate the feasibility of the approach by an empirical evaluation showing the performance of the tool. Copyright 2014 ACM.},

abstract={In the context of Software Product Line (SPL) reuse paradigm, one of the most widely used models is the feature model. It describes the set of products in an SPL in terms of their features and the relationships among them. A feature is an externally desired service by the system. While features concern functional aspects, non-functional features must also be considered which have impact on the quality of the SPL derived systems. For this purpose, Extended feature models are proposed in the literature. In order to verify the consistency of such models, several techniques are proposed. We adopt a formal approach that represents Extended Feature Models and reason about them for proving consistency and other operations. In this paper, we show the impact of non-functional attributes on the analysis operations of feature models. In this work, we have resumed analysis operations of feature models listed in the literature. Moreover, we studied the effect of adding the non-functional attributes on these operations by giving examples. So this has enabled us to emphasize the presence of three types of constraints namely: constraint value, constraint attribute-attribute and constraint feature-attribute. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={In Software Product Lines (SPL), quality evaluation is a critical factor, because an error in a SPL can spread to various end products. However, it is often proved impractical to ensure the quality of all products of a given SPL both for economic reasons and the effort needed due to their large number. In this context, a strategy that can be used is to make quality assessments on the initial phases of the SPL development. This approach avoids having errors that could be propagated to the next SPL phases. So, taking into account the feature model, which is one of the most important artifacts in a SPL since its quality directly affects the quality of the SPL end products, to assure the quality of the feature model is one of the current strategies to assess the quality of a SPL. In this sense, one way to evaluate the feature model is to use measures, which could be associated with the feature model quality characteristics and their quality attributes. This paper presents a measures catalog, which can be used to support the quality evaluation of the feature model. In order to identify these measures, a systematic mapping is conducted and to validate the measures catalog, we perform a peer review with experts in software quality and SPL. Besides that, to evaluate the use of the proposed catalog, we apply the measures in three feature models in the domain of mobile applications. The results show that the proposed measures catalog can be effectively deployed to support the quality evaluation of the feature models. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

abstract={Variability management aims at taming variability in large and complex software product lines. To efficiently manage variability, it has to be modeled using formal representations, such as feature or decision models. Such models are efficient in many domains, where variability is about switching on and off features, or using parameters to customize products of the product line. However, variability can be represented in the form of a topology in domains where variability is about connecting components in a certain order, in specific interconnected hierarchies, or in different quantities. In this experience report, we explore topological variability within a case study of large-scale fire alarm systems. We identify core characteristics of the variability, derive modeling requirements, model the variability using UML2 class diagrams, and discuss the applicability of further variability modeling languages. We show that, although challenging, class diagrams can suffice to represent topological variability in order to generate a configurator tool. In contrast, modeling parallel and recursive structures, cycles, informal constraints, and orthogonal hierarchies were among the main experienced challenges that require further research.

abstract={The growing trend towards the automation and externalization of business processes by means of Technology Infrastructure (TI), such as Business Process Management Systems, has increased the security risks in the organizations. In the majority of cases, the issue of security is overlooked by default in these systems. Therefore, the early selection and implementation of security controls that mitigate risks is a real and crucial need. Nevertheless, there exists an enormous range of IT security controls and their configuration is a human, manual, time-consuming and error-prone task. In addition, security controls are implemented out separately from the organization perspective and involve many stakeholders. This separation makes difficult to ensure the effectiveness of these controls with regard to organizational requirements. In this article, we propose a formalization of security controls based on security pattern templates and feature models. This formalization allows applying feature domain-oriented analysis and constraint programming techniques for the automatic inference, selection and generation of optimal security controls with regard to single and multiple business objectives. © The Author 2014.},

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to improve the multi-stakeholder configuration process, considering stakeholders' preferences expressed through both hard and soft constraints. Based on such preferences, we recommend different product configurations using different strategies from the social choice theory. We conducted an empirical study to evaluate the effectiveness of our strategies with respect to individual stakeholder satisfaction and fairness among all stakeholders.

In these fields, the strong domain orientation leads to the need to manage interrelated SPLs and multiple instances of configured sub-products, resulting in complex configurations that cannot be easily represented by simple sets of features. In this paper we propose a tooled approach to manage such SPLs through a domain model that interrelates several feature models in a consistent way. The approach thus shifts part of the domain knowledge to the problem space and supports the derivation of complex configurations with multiple instantiations and associations of sub-products. We also report on the application of our approach to an industrialstrength software development in the field of digital signage. Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).},

Rather than developing software from scratch for a new project, a new configuration of the SPL is produced. It is hard, however, to find a configuration of an SPL that meets an arbitrary requirement set and does not violate any configuration constraints in the SPL. Existing research has focused on techniques that produce a configuration of an SPL in a single step. Budgetary constraints or other restrictions, however, may require multi-step configuration processes. For example, an aircraft manufacturer may want to produce a series of configurations of a plane over a span of years without exceeding a yearly budget to add features. This paper provides three contributions to the study of multi-step configuration for SPLs. First, we present a formal model of multi-step SPL configuration and map this model to constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). Second, we show how solutions to these SPL configuration problems can be automatically derived with a constraint solver by mapping them to CSPs. Moreover, we show how feature model changes can be mapped to our approach in a multi-step scenario by using feature model drift. Third, we present empirical results demonstrating that our CSP-based reasoning technique can scale to SPL models with hundreds of features and multiple configuration steps. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={In a software product line (SPL), a collection of software products is defined by their commonalities in terms of features rather than explicitly specifying all products one-by-one. Several verification techniques were adapted to establish temporal properties of SPLs. Symbolic and family-based model checking have been proven to be successful for tackling the combinatorial blow-up arising when reasoning about several feature combinations. However, most formal verification approaches for SPLs presented in the literature focus on the static SPLs, where the features of a product are fixed and cannot be changed during runtime. This is in contrast to dynamic SPLs, allowing to adapt feature combinations of a product dynamically after deployment. The main contribution of the paper is a compositional modeling framework for dynamic SPLs, which supports probabilistic and nondeterministic choices and allows for quantitative analysis. We specify the feature changes during runtime within an automata-based coordination component, enabling to reason over strategies how to trigger dynamic feature changes for optimizing various quantitative objectives, e.g., energy or monetary costs and reliability. For our framework there is a natural and conceptually simple translation into the input language of the prominent probabilistic model checker PRISM. This facilitates the application of PRISM's powerful symbolic engine to the operational behavior of dynamic SPLs and their family-based analysis against various quantitative queries. We demonstrate feasibility of our approach by a case study issuing an energy-aware bonding network device. Copyright © 2014 ACM. Copyright © 2014 ACM.},

Since the available time for test activities is limited an efficiency improvement is needed to ensure that products have sufficient quality. This paper introduces risk-based testing for software product lines. Our approach is based on risk based testing for single system engineering which is extended with a dimension that captures the percentage of product variants that use a particular development artifact. Based on the risk of development artifacts, the priorities for domain and application engineering are determined. We demonstrate our approach using a case study from an existing product line and discuss tool support. We conclude that the basic ideas behind risk-based testing for product lines are intuitive, pragmatic in nature, and provide the means for practitioners for guiding the test effort.

In this paper, we present the general principles, extrapolated from [7,8], which make us believe that mCRL2 can also be used for behavioral variability analysis of product families. The mCRL2 data language allows to smoothly deal with feature sets and attributes, its process language is sufficiently rich to model feature selection, as well as product behavior based on an FTS-like semantics. Because of the feature-orientation, our modeling strategy allows a natural refactoring of the semantic model of a product family into a parallel composition of components that reflects coherent sets of features. This opens the way for dedicated abstraction and reduction techniques that strengthen the prospect of a scalable verification approach to software product lines. In this paper, we sketch how to model product families in mCRL2 and how to apply a modular verification method, preparing the ground to further assess the scalability of our approach, in particular regarding model checking.

Besides the large sets of process variants to be managed in such dynamic systems, process variants need to be context sensitive in order to accommodate new user requirements and intrinsic complexity. This paradigm shift forces us to defer decisions to runtime where process variants must be customized and executed based on a recognized context. However, there exists a lack of deferral of the entire process variant configuration and execution to perform an automated decision of subsequent variation points at runtime. In this paper, we present a holistic methodology to automatically resolve process variability at runtime. The proposed solution performs a staged configuration considering static and dynamic context data to accomplish effective decision making. We demonstrate our approach by exemplifying a storage operation process in a smart logistics scenario.

abstract={In software product line engineering (SPLE), many studies have been conducted on commonality- and variability-based feature extraction methods and on the reasoning and refinement of feature models (FMs), aiming to enhance the appropriateness and reusability of the constructed FMs in compliance with feature-oriented development. The existing methods, however, failed to assure the developed applications that contain ambiguities between the features generated in FMs by analyzers' intuitions, and hindered the reuse of such applications. Moreover, the accuracy measurements of models based on mathematics-based theoretical verification methods are difficult to apply in practice. Therefore, a refinement technique is demanded to enhance the FM accuracy. This paper aims to identify abnormal feature duplications and collisions based on the feature attributes to address the potential ambiguities between the features in an FM generated for a target domain, and to construct more precise FMs by presenting a technique for eliminating such abnormalities. For this purpose, the profiles of the formalized attributes were first defined based on MDR. Based on the semantics and relationships between the attributes, the duplications and collisions were identified using an analysis matrix, and were generalized to formulate rules by level. Such rules were evaluated to remove the duplications and collisions. In addition, using a supporting analyzer, the features in the initial FM were registered on a repository and were analyzed for feature duplications and collisions based on the saved attribute data. The refinements of the ambiguities between such features are likely to enable the construction of more precise application FMs and the generation of common features with higher reusability. Further, the environments using support tools are expected to provide convenience in the similarity analysis and reuse of features. © 2014 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

Models serve a dual purpose: to brainstorm and communicate. A very sophisticated yet unreadable model is arguably useless. To date, there has not been a scientific evaluation of the cognitive effectiveness of the visual syntax of feature diagrams. [Principle Ideas] This paper presents a scientific evaluation of the cognitive effectiveness of feature diagrams. The evaluation approach is based on theory and empirical evidence mainly from the cognitive science field. [Contribution] The evaluation reveals drawbacks in the visual notation of feature diagrams.

abstract={Much activity within software product line engineering has been concerned with explicitly representing and exploiting commonality and variability at the feature level for the purpose of a particular engineering task e.g. requirements specification, design, coding, verification, product derivation process, but not for comparing how similar products in the product line are with each other. In contrast, a case-based approach to software development is concerned with descriptions and models as a set of software cases stored in a repository for the purpose of searching at a product level, typically as a foundation for new product development. New products are derived by finding the most similar product descriptions in the repository using similarity metrics. The new idea is to use such similarity metrics for mining variability from software repositories. In this sense, software product line engineering could be informed by the case-based approach. This approach requires defining and implementing such similarity metrics based on the representations used for the software cases in such a repository. It provides complementary benefits to the ones given through feature-based representations of variability and may help mining such variability. Copyright 2014 ACM.},

abstract={Test prioritization is crucial for testing products in a product line considering limited budget in terms of available time and resources. In general, it is not practically feasible to execute all the possible test cases and so, ordering test case execution permits test engineers to discover faults earlier in the testing process. An efficient prioritization of test cases for one or more products requires a clear consideration of the tradeoff among various costs (e.g., time, required resources) and effectiveness (e.g., feature coverage) objectives. As an integral part of the future Cisco's test scheduling system for validating video conferencing products, we introduce a search-based multi-objective test prioritization technique, considering multiple cost and effectiveness measures. In particular, our multi-objective optimization setup includes the minimization of execution cost (e.g., time), and the maximization of number of prioritized test cases, feature pairwise coverage and fault detection capability. Based on cost-effectiveness measures, a novel fitness function is defined for such test prioritization problem. The fitness function is empirically evaluated together with three commonly used search algorithms (e.g., (1+1) Evolutionary algorithm (EA)) and Random Search as a comparison baseline based on the Cisco's industrial case study and 500 artificial designed problems. The results show that (1+1) EA achieves the best performance for solving the test prioritization problem and it scales up to solve the problems of varying complexity.

Such products are usually represented with a Feature Model (FM). Testing the entire SPL may not be conceivable due to economical or time constraints and, more simply, because of the large number of potential products. Thus, defining methods for generating test configurations is required, and is now a very active research topic for the testing community. In this context, mutation has recently being advertised as a promising technique. Mutation evaluates the ability of the test suite to detect defective versions of the FM, called mutants. In particular, it has been shown that existing test configurations achieving the mutation criterion correlate with fault detection. Despite the potential benefit of mutation, there is no approach which aims at generating test configurations for SPL with respect to the mutation criterion. In this direction, we introduce a search-based approach which explores the SPL product space to generate product test configurations with the aim of detecting mutants. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract={Modern software systems are highly configurable in order to satisfy diverse customer requirements and application contexts. Feature models provide a well-established formalism for tailoring configuration spaces of applications. Thereupon, multi-view staged configuration approaches modularize feature models for separation of concerns and apply workflow modeling for scheduling configuration decisions. However, the complex, often oblivious and even cyclic logical dependencies among configuration decisions obstruct compositional semantics of feature model views thus spoiling intuitive modeling and rigorous analysis of staged configuration processes. In this paper, we apply workflow Petri nets (WPNs) as a formal operational model for staged configuration that makes explicit causal dependencies among feature selections. For the internal separation into composable configuration stages we further adopt the principles of open workflow nets. It is shown that the soundness notion of WPNs naturally coincides with fundamental correctness and liveness properties to be verified for staged configuration processes. We present a prototype implementation for an automated computation of staged configuration processes and provide experimental results concerning scalability properties. Copyright 2014 ACM.},

abstract={Multi-tenancy is a key pillar of cloud services. It allows different tenants to share computing resources transparently and, at the same time, guarantees substantial cost savings for the providers. However, from a user perspective, one of the major drawbacks of multi-tenancy is lack of configurability. Depending on the isolation degree, the same service instance and even the same service configuration may be shared among multiple tenants (i.e. shared multi-tenant service). Moreover tenants usually have different - and in most of the cases - conicting configuration preferences. To over-come this limitation, this paper introduces a novel approach to support user-centric adaptation in shared multi-tenant services. The adaptation objective aims to maximise tenants' satisfaction, even when tenants and their preferences change during the service life-time. This paper describes how to engineer the activities of the MAPE loop to support user-centric adaptation, and focuses on the analysis of tenants' preferences. In particular, we use a game theoretic analysis to identify a service configuration that maximises tenants' preferences satisfaction. We illustrate and motivate our approach by utilising a multi-tenant desktop scenario. Obtained experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed analysis.},

abstract={Software Product Line (SPL) testing is challenging due to the potentially huge number of derivable products. To alleviate this problem, numerous contributions have been proposed to reduce the number of products to be tested while still having a good coverage. However, not much attention has been paid to the order in which the products are tested. Test case prioritization techniques reorder test cases to meet a certain performance goal. For instance, testers may wish to order their test cases in order to detect faults as soon as possible, which would translate in faster feedback and earlier fault correction. In this paper, we explore the applicability of test case prioritization techniques to SPL testing. We propose five different prioritization criteria based on common metrics of feature models and we compare their effectiveness in increasing the rate of early fault detection, i.e. a measure of how quickly faults are detected. The results show that different orderings of the same SPL suite may lead to significant differences in the rate of early fault detection. They also show that our approach may contribute to accelerate the detection of faults of SPL test suites based on combinatorial testing. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Exhaustively testing every product of a software product line (SPL) is a difficult task due to the combinatorial explosion of the number of products. Combinatorial interaction testing is a technique to reduce the number of products under test. However, it is typically up-to the tester in which order these products are tested. We propose a similarity-based prioritization to be applied on these products before they are generated. The proposed approach does not guarantee to find more errors than sampling approaches, but it aims at increasing interaction coverage of an SPL under test as fast as possible over time. This is especially beneficial since usually the time budget for testing is limited. We implemented similarity-based prioritization in FeatureIDE and evaluated it by comparing its outcome to the default outcome of three sampling algorithms as well as to random orders. The experiment results indicate that the order with similarity-based prioritization is better than random orders and often better than the default order of existing sampling algorithms.

The database community observed that these "one size fits all" systems provide poor performance for special domains; systems that are tailored for a single domain usually perform better, have smaller memory footprint, and less energy consumption. These advantages do not only originate from different requirements, but also from differences within individual domains, such as using a certain storage device. However, implementing specialized systems means to reimplement large parts of a database system again and again, which is neither feasible for many customers nor efficient in terms of costs and time. To overcome these limitations, we envision applying techniques known from software product lines to database systems in order to provide tailor-made and robust database systems for nearly every application scenario with reasonable effort in cost and time.

abstract={Feature models have been widely adopted to reuse the requirements of a set of similar products in a domain. In feature models' construction, one basic task is to ensure the consistency of feature models, which often involves detecting and fixing of inconsistencies in feature models. While many approaches have been proposed, most of them focus on detecting inconsistencies rather than fixing inconsistencies. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic-priority based approach to interactively fixing inconsistencies in feature models, and report an implementation of a system that not only automatically recommends a solution to fixing inconsistencies but also supports domain analysts to gradually reach the desirable solution by dynamically adjusting priorities of constraints. The key technical contribution is, as far as we are aware, the first application of the constraint hierarchy theory to feature modeling, where the degree of domain analysts' confidence on constraints is expressed by using priority and inconsistencies are resolved by deleting one or more lower-priority constraints. Two case studies demonstrate the usability and scalability (efficiency) of our new approach. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

This paper presents a tool-supported reverse-engineering process to semi-automatically extract configuration-specific data from a legacy Web configurator. The extracted and structured data is stored in formal models (e.g., variability models) and can be used in a forward-engineering process to generate a customized interface with an underlying reliable reasoning engine. Two major components are presented: (1) a Web Wrapper that extracts structured configuration-specific data from unstructured or semistructured Web pages of a configurator, and (2) a Web Crawler that explores the 'configuration space' (i.e., all objects representing configuration-specific data) and simulates users' configuration actions. We describe variability data extraction patterns, used on top of the Wrapper and the Crawler to extract configuration data. Experimental results on five existing Web configurators show that the specification of a few variability patterns enable the identification of hundreds of options. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={As model transformations are fundamental to model-driven engineering, assuring their quality is a central task which can be achieved by testing with sufficiently adequate and large test suites. As the latter requirement can render manual testing prohibitively costly in practice, a high level of automation is advisable. Triple Graph Grammars (TGGs) have been shown to provide a promising solution to this challenge as not only test case generators, but also generic test oracles can be derived from them. It is, however, unclear if such generated test suites are indeed adequate and, as different strategies can be used to steer the test generation process, a systematic means of comparing and evaluating such test suites and strategies is required. In this paper, we extend existing work on TGG-based testing by(i) presenting a generic framework for TGG-based testing, (ii) describing a concrete instantiation of this framework with our TGG tool eMoflon, and (iii) exploring how the well-known technique of mutation analysis can be used to evaluate a set of test generation strategies by analyzing the generated test suites. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract={Software Product Line Engineering (SPL) should ensure the correctness, completeness and consistency of its artefacts and related domain to prevent the propagation of defects in derived products. Software inspection techniques are effective in detecting defects in software artefacts and avoiding their propagation throughout the software development process. However, the results of a quasi-systematic review of the technical literature reported in this paper pointed to a lack of such techniques to support the inspection of SPL artefacts, including techniques to support the inspection of feature models (FMs) that are largely used in domain modelling. Therefore, a checklist-based inspection technique (FMCheck) has been developed to support the detection of defects on FMs. FMCheck is configurable and can be applied to the original feature model notation (the FODA approach) and its extensions, including the Odyssey-FEX notation. The inspection technique was empirically evaluated, having indicated its feasibility and effectiveness. It is possible to see that inspectors applying FMCheck to inspect FMs can be more effective than those applying ad-hoc techniques, regarding four distinct domains. © J.UCS.},

abstract={Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) is a successful paradigm to produce a family of products for a specific domain. A challenge in SPLE is to check that different models used in early SPL specification do not contain inconsistent information that may be propagated and generate inconsistent products that do not conform to its requirements. This challenge is difficult to address due to the high number of possible combinations of product features and model fragments specifying those features. Variability Consistency Checking (VCC) offers automatic means to address that challenge. VCC relates information inferred from the relationships between features and from base models related to those features. Validating if all the products in an SPL satisfy user-defined consistency constraints is based on searching for a satisfying assignment of each formula generated by VCC. We validated VCC and its supporting tool on two case studies from different application domains, the results were encouraging as we did not observed significant performance penalties. © J.UCS.},

abstract={Software product line engineering is an efficient means to generate a set of tailored software products from a common implementation. However, adopting a product-line approach poses a major challenge and significant risks, since typically legacy code must be migrated toward a product line. Our aim is to lower the adoption barrier by providing semi-automatic tool support-called variability mining-to support developers in locating, documenting, and extracting implementations of product-line features from legacy code. Variability mining combines prior work on concern location, reverse engineering, and variability-aware type systems, but is tailored specifically for the use in product lines. Our work pursues three technical goals: (1) we provide a consistency indicator based on a variability-aware type system, (2) we mine features at a fine level of granularity, and (3) we exploit domain knowledge about the relationship between features when available. With a quantitative study, we demonstrate that variability mining can efficiently support developers in locating features. © 2014 IEEE.},

In such dynamic environments, organizations need to reinforce their capabilities to deal with the simultaneity of multiple NPD projects, as well as with the frequent changes of the product scope. Many organizations, that have adopted the typical NPD process enforcing a streamlined product development process, are challenged beyond strict planning and rigorous control of their NPD projects.This paper identifies the challenges to manage the scope of a complete portfolio of NPD projects within the dynamic context that organizations face today, and using existing scope management practices. This paper suggests a novel approach to structuring the scope in dynamic NPD portfolios using feature modeling, and illustrates its use in an action-research case. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Despite the wide use of software product lines, their implementation and evolution is a challenging task. When implementing a feature, a developer has to know which code fragments of other (already implemented) features are accessible in each program variant in which the feature is included. Especially for composition-based implementation techniques, in which the code is implemented in separated modules, it is an exhausting and error-prone task to find safely accessible code fragments of other modules. State-of-the-art tool support, such as product-line type checkers, detect errors a posteriori (i.e., during compilation), but fails to prevent errors during the implementation. To overcome this problem, we propose feature-context interfaces, which provide a modular and non-variable programming interface to the variable source code of a product line. These interfaces ease changes, extensions, and the maintainability of product lines. To demonstrate applicability, we implemented a content assist and an outline view in Eclipse based on feature-context interfaces. We evaluate the potential of our method by analyzing the number of potential type errors we prevent compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Copyright 2014 ACM.},

abstract={Dataflow modelling languages such as SCADE or Simulink are the de-facto standard for the Model Driven Development of safety critical embedded control and command systems. Software is mainly being produced by Automated Code Generators whose correctness can only be assessed meaningfully if the input language semantics is well known. These semantics share a common part but are mainly defined through block libraries. The writing of a complete formal specification for the block libraries of the usual languages is highly challenging due to the high variability of the structure and semantics of each block. This contribution relates the use of software product line principles in the design of a domain specific language targeting the formal specification of block libraries. It summarises the advantages of this DSL regarding the writing, validation and formal verification of such specifications. These experiments have been carried out in the context of the GeneAuto embedded code generator project targeting Simulink and Scicos; and are being extended and applied in its follow up projects ProjetP and Hi-MoCo.

abstract={The User Requirements Notation (URN) is an international requirements engineering standard published by the International Telecommunication Union. URN supports goal-oriented and scenario-based modeling as well as analysis. Feature modeling, on the other hand, is a well-establishing technique for capturing commonalities and variabilities of Software Product Lines. When combined with URN, it is possible to reason about the impact of feature configurations on stakeholder goals and system qualities, thus helping to identify the most appropriate features for a stakeholder. Combined reasoning of goal and feature models is also fundamental to Concern-Driven Development, where concerns are composed not only based on functionality expressed with feature models, but also based on impact on stakeholder goals. Therefore, an analysis technique for feature and goal models based on a single conceptual model is desirable, because of its potential to streamline model analysis and reduce the complexity of the analysis framework. This paper introduces such a technique, i.e., a single, propagation-based reasoning algorithm that supports combined reasoning of goal and feature models and offers additional usability improvements over existing goal-oriented reasoning mechanisms. © 2014 IEEE.},

For a selection of features, specialized products of one domain can be generated automatically from domain artifacts. However, analyses of software product lines need to handle a large number of products that can be exponential in the number of features. In the last decade, many approaches have been proposed to analyze software product lines efficiently. For some of these approaches tool support is available. Based on a recent survey on analysis for software product lines, we provide a first overview on such tools. While our discussion is limited to analysis tools, we provide an accompanying website covering further tools for product-line development. We compare tools according to their analysis and implementation strategy to identify underrepresented areas. In addition, we want to ease the reuse of existing tools for researchers and students, and to simplify research transfer to practice. Copyright 2014 ACM.},

Simultaneously, the increasing pressure to develop software in less time and at lower costs drives software industry towards the promising paradigm of Software Product Line (SPL). However, different approaches have been advanced for modeling NFR of the traditional individual products and few approaches focused on a family of products. On the other hand, as a product line contains several products, it is impracticable and not feasible to verify NFR for each possible product. Therefore, there is a major need for verification approaches specific to product lines. In this paper, we present and analyze the main NFR modeling and verification approaches of SPL. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Variability management is a key issue when building and evolving software-intensive systems, making it possible to extend, configure, customize and adapt such systems to customers’ needs and specific deployment contexts. A wide form of variability can be found in extensible software systems, typically built on top of plugin-based architectures that offer a (large) number of configuration options through plugins. In an ideal world, a software architect should be able to generate a system variant on-demand, corresponding to a particular assembly of plugins. To this end, the variation points and constraints between architectural elements should be properly modeled and maintained over time (i.e., for each version of an architecture). A crucial, yet error-prone and time-consuming, task for a software architect is to build an accurate representation of the variability of an architecture, in order to prevent unsafe architectural variants and reach the highest possible level of flexibility. In this article, we propose a reverse engineering process for producing a variability model (i.e., a feature model) of a plugin-based architecture. We develop automated techniques to extract and combine different variability descriptions, including a hierarchical software architecture model, a plugin dependency model and the software architect knowledge. By computing and reasoning about differences between versions of architectural feature models, software architect can control both the variability extraction and evolution processes. The proposed approach has been applied to a representative, large-scale plugin-based system (FraSCAti), considering different versions of its architecture. We report on our experience in this context. © 2013, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Automated analysis tools seem to be adequate mechanisms to solve this issue, but currently there is a problem of mismatch between the information available in the models, and the information that the automated mechanisms require. To address this, this paper proposes a characterization of analysis functions, which makes explicit the information that each one requires to be executable (among other things). Furthermore, the paper presents ArchiAnalysis, an extensible tool for applying analysis functions over ArchiMate models. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.},

abstract={Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE) has proven successful on several stages of the software development life cycle. It has also been applied to different challenges in the context of Software Product Lines (SPLs) like generating minimal test suites. When reverse engineering SPLs from legacy software an important challenge is the reverse engineering of variability, often expressed in the form of Feature Models (FMs). The synthesis of FMs has been studied with techniques such as Genetic Algorithms. In this paper we explore the use of Genetic Programming for this task. We sketch our general workflow, the GP pipeline employed, and its evolutionary operators. We report our experience in synthesizing feature models from sets of feature combinations for 17 representative feature models, and analyze the results using standard information retrieval metrics. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract={Nowadays, the society is dependent on Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), which are complex systems that combine digital technologies and physical processes. The need for dealing with constant changes in products is leading these systems to handle variability in several aspects, which entails to a considerable increase in the complexity of the systems. Many of the research efforts are focused on the efficient development of these systems. Nevertheless, the infeasibility of testing all the possible configurations, the unclear notion of the achieved test coverage and the high amount of time required make testing processes non-systematic and challenging. This paper introduces the main problems for testing highly configurable CPSs and proposes a novel approach for testing systematically and efficiently while achieving high test coverage.},

abstract={Software-product-line engineering has gained considerable momentum in recent years, both in industry and in academia. A software product line is a family of software products that share a common set of features. Software product lines challenge traditional analysis techniques, such as type checking, model checking, and theorem proving, in their quest of ensuring correctness and reliability of software. Simply creating and analyzing all products of a product line is usually not feasible, due to the potentially exponential number of valid feature combinations. Recently, researchers began to develop analysis techniques that take the distinguishing properties of software product lines into account, for example, by checking feature-related code in isolation or by exploiting variability information during analysis. The emerging field of productline analyses is both broad and diverse, so it is difficult for researchers and practitioners to understand their similarities and differences. We propose a classification of product-line analyses to enable systematic research and application. Based on our insights with classifying and comparing a corpus of 123 research articles, we develop a research agenda to guide future research on product-line analyses. © 2014 ACM.},

abstract={Context Advances in customization have highlighted the need for tools supporting variable content document management and generation in many domains. Current tools allow the generation of highly customized documents that are variable in both content and layout. However, most frameworks are technology-oriented, and their use requires advanced skills in implementation-related tools, which means their use by end users (i.e. document designers) is severely limited. Objective Starting from past and current trends for customized document authoring, our goal is to provide a document generation alternative in which variants are specified at a high level of abstraction and content reuse can be maximized in high variability scenarios. Method Based on our experience in Document Engineering, we identified areas in the variable content document management and generation field open to further improvement. We first classified the primary sources of variability in document composition processes and then developed a methodology, which we called DPL - based on Software Product Lines principles - to support document generation in high variability scenarios. Results In order to validate the applicability of our methodology we implemented a tool - DPLfw - to carry out DPL processes. After using this in different scenarios, we compared our proposal with other state-of-the-art tools for variable content document management and generation. Conclusion The DPLfw showed a good capacity for the automatic generation of variable content documents equal to or in some cases surpassing other currently available approaches. To the best of our knowledge, DPLfw is the only framework that combines variable content and document workflow facilities, easing the generation of variable content documents in which multiple actors play different roles. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The composition of software components can be used to fit specific application needs. Finding feasible and, moreover, optimal compositions demands extensive domain knowledge from the developer - with respect to both application requirements and used components. Frameworks can provide support for the composition selection based on requirements, component properties, and their dependencies. Their description, however, becomes complex in practice. In this paper, we propose the ProDesc framework. It contains a property description language with a bespoke type system for describing properties of software components and their operations. ProDesc can express compositional variability, including dependencies of properties on the environment and on other components. A UML-like graphical notation and transformations to feature diagrams support the software developer. The most suitable component composition is selected based on a utility function, which is evaluated during runtime. Our approach raises the abstraction level, leads to a clear separation of concerns, reduces the development time, and facilitates optimized software. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract={Context: Variability (i.e., the ability of software systems or artifacts to be adjusted for different contexts) became a key property of many systems. Objective: We analyze existing research on variability in software systems. We investigate variability handling in major software engineering phases (e.g., requirements engineering, architecting). Method: We performed a systematic literature review. A manual search covered 13 premium software engineering journals and 18 premium conferences, resulting in 15,430 papers searched and 196 papers considered for analysis. To improve reliability and to increase reproducibility, we complemented the manual search with a targeted automated search. Results: Software quality attributes have not received much attention in the context of variability. Variability is studied in all software engineering phases, but testing is underrepresented. Data to motivate the applicability of current approaches are often insufficient; research designs are vaguely described. Conclusions: Based on our findings we propose dimensions of variability in software engineering. This empirically grounded classification provides a step towards a unifying, integrated perspective of variability in software systems, spanning across disparate or loosely coupled research themes in the software engineering community. Finally, we provide recommendations to bridge the gap between research and practice and point to opportunities for future research. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Software Product Lines (SPLs) are families of related software products, each with its own set of feature combinations. Their commonly large number of products poses a unique set of challenges for software testing as it might not be technologically or economically feasible to test of all them individually. SPL pairwise testing aims at selecting a set of products to test such that all possible combinations of two features are covered by at least one selected product. Most approaches for SPL pairwise testing have focused on achieving full coverage of all pairwise feature combinations with the minimum number of products to test. Though useful in many contexts, this single-objective perspective does not reflect the prevailing scenario where software engineers do face trade-offs between the objectives of maximizing the coverage or minimizing the number of products to test. In contrast and to address this need, our work is the first to propose a classical multi-objective formalisation where both objectives are equally important. In this paper, we study the application to SPL pairwise testing of four classical multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. We developed three seeding strategies - techniques that leverage problem domain knowledge - and measured their performance impact on a large and diverse corpus of case studies using two well-known multi-objective quality measures. Our study identifies the performance differences among the algorithms and corroborates that the more domain knowledge leveraged the better the search results. Our findings enable software engineers to select not just one solution (as in the case of single-objective techniques) but instead to select from an array of test suite possibilities the one that best matches the economical and technological constraints of their testing context. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Context Testing plays an important role in the quality assurance process for software product line engineering. There are many opportunities for economies of scope and scale in the testing activities, but techniques that can take advantage of these opportunities are still needed. Objective The objective of this study is to identify testing strategies that have the potential to achieve these economies, and to provide a synthesis of available research on SPL testing strategies, to be applied towards reaching higher defect detection rates and reduced quality assurance effort. Method We performed a literature review of two hundred seventy-six studies published from the year 1998 up to the 1st semester of 2013. We used several filters to focus the review on the most relevant studies and we give detailed analyses of the core set of studies. Results The analysis of the reported strategies comprised two fundamental aspects for software product line testing: the selection of products for testing, and the actual test of products. Our findings indicate that the literature offers a large number of techniques to cope with such aspects. However, there is a lack of reports on realistic industrial experiences, which limits the inferences that can be drawn.

A key insight is that there is no one-size-fits-all solution or no clear superiority of a solution compared to another. On the contrary, we found that it does make sense to continue the maintenance of an external and internal DSL. Based on our experience and on an analysis of the DSL engineering field, the vision that we foresee for the future of software languages is their ability to be self-adaptable to the most appropriate shape (including the corresponding integrated development environment) according to a particular usage or task.

abstract={Context Variability modeling, and in particular feature modeling, is a central element of model-driven software product line architectures. Such architectures often emerge from legacy code, but, creating feature models from large, legacy systems is a long and arduous task. We describe three synthesis scenarios that can benefit from the algorithms in this paper. Objective This paper addresses the problem of automatic synthesis of feature models from propositional constraints. We show that the decision version of the problem is NP-hard. We designed two efficient algorithms for synthesis of feature models from CNF and DNF formulas respectively. Method We performed an experimental evaluation of the algorithms against a binary decision diagram (BDD)-based approach and a formal concept analysis (FCA)-based approach using models derived from realistic models. Results Our evaluation shows a 10 to 1,000-fold performance improvement for our algorithms over the BDD-based approach. The performance of the DNF-based algorithm was similar to the FCA-based approach, with advantages for both techniques. We identified input properties that affect the runtimes of the CNF- and DNF-based algorithms. Conclusions Our algorithms are the first known techniques that are efficient enough to be used on dependencies extracted from real systems, opening new possibilities of creating reverse engineering and model management tools for variability models. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={High demands regarding the variability of automation software motivate organizations to automate the configuration process. In practice, this often leads to the development of custom configuration tools designed specifically for configuring the automation software they were developed for. This approach works well as long as both, the development of the software and the configurator are under the full control of the organization. However, software platforms are increasingly open, i.e., key customers add capabilities and thereby change the platform's variability. Often, these customers create a new platform themselves, which they offer to their customers. Moving from a closed platform to a software ecosystem means that development and variability management happen at multiple layers involving multiple teams with different backgrounds. This poses new requirements regarding the flexibility of configuration tools. In this paper, we report experiences and issues with a custom-developed configurator currently in use in an industrial automation software ecosystem. We describe how a model-based tool can be applied to address these issues and provide a scenario-based comparison of the custom-developed solution and the model-based configurator.

abstract={Software product line engineering (SPLE) enables systematic reuse in development of a family of related software systems by explicitly defining commonalities and variabilities among the individual products in the family. Nowadays, SPLE is used in a variety of complex domains such as avionics and automotive. As such domains include safety critical systems which exhibit probabilistic behavior, there is a major need for modeling and verification approaches dealing with probabilistic aspects of systems in the presence of variabilities. In this paper, we introduce a mathematical model, Discrete Time Markov Chain Family (DTMCF), which compactly represents the probabilistic behavior of all the products in the product line. We also provide a probabilistic model checking method to verify DTMCFs against Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL) properties. This way, instead of verifying each product individually, the whole family is model checked at once, resulting in the set of products satisfying the desired property. This reduces the required cost for model checking by eliminating redundant processing caused by the commonalities among the products. Copyright 2013 ACM.},

abstract={Managing in a generic way the evolution process of feature-oriented Software Product Lines (spls) is complex due to the number of elements that are impacted and the heterogeneity of the spls regarding artifacts used to define them. Existing work presents specific approaches to manage the evolution of spls in terms of such artifacts, i.e., assets, feature models and relation definitions. Moreover stakeholders do not necessarily master all the knowledge of the spl making its evolution difficult and error-prone without a proper tool support. In order to deal with these issues, we introduce SPLEmma, a generic framework that follows a Model Driven Engineering approach to capture the evolution of a spl independently of the kind of assets, technologies or feature models used for the product derivation. Authorized changes are described by the spl maintainer and captured in a model used to generate tools that guide the evolution process and preserve the consistency of the whole spl. We report on the application of our approach on two spls: YourCast for digital signage systems, and SALOON, which enables generation of configurations for cloud providers. Copyright 2013 ACM.},

Variability has a natural appearance in complex environments of different enterprises, where even similar BPs can have varying facets on the cross-enterprise scale. Yet, despite this fact current development tools for hybrid MBAs are lacking systematic variability management. Further, the literature on this particular technological landscape is scarce.

abstract={Specific requirements of clients lead to the development of variants of the same software. These variants form a Software Product Line (SPL). Ideally, testing a SPL involves testing all the software products that can be configured through the combination of features. This, however, is intractable in practice since a) large SPLs can lead to millions of possible software variants and b) the testing process is usually limited by budget and time constraints. To overcome this problem, this paper introduces PLEDGE, an open source tool that selects and prioritizes the product configurations maximizing the feature interactions covered. The uniqueness of PLEDGE is that it bypasses the computation of the feature interactions, allowing to scale to large SPLs. Copyright 2013 ACM.},

abstract={The Mining Software Repositories (MSR) field reveals knowledge for software development by analyzing data stored in repositories such as source control and bug trace systems. In order to reveal the knowledge, MSR researchers need to perform complicated procedures iteratively. To help the complex work of MSR practitioners, we study the construction of domain specific languages (DSLs) for MSR. We have conducted feature-oriented domain analysis (FODA) on MSR and developed a DSL based on the feature model. In this paper, we expand our previous work and propose to construct not a single DSL but a DSL family. A DSL family consists of a series of DSLs with commonality in their domain but suitable to specific applications of MSR. To readily construct these DSLs, we use Alloy to encode the feature model. Our encoding includes not only the DSL features and their relations but also some composition rules that can be used to generate the syntax of DSLs. Based on this, we can automatically derive the language elements to construct DSLs suitable to specific purposes of MSR. Copyright 2013 ACM.},

abstract={Dynamic Software Product Line (DSPL) Engineering has gained interest through its promise of being able to unify software adaptation whereby software adaptation can be realised at compile time and runtime. While previous work has enabled program logic adaptation by the use of language extensions and platform support, little attention has been placed on Graphical User Interface (GUI) variability. Different design patterns including the Model View Controller are commonly used in GUI implementation, with GUI documents being used for declaring the GUI. To handle dynamic GUI variability currently, the developer needs to implement GUI refinements using multiple techniques. This paper proposes a solution for dealing with GUI document variability, statically and dynamically, in a unified way. In our approach, we currently use a compile time method for producing GUI variants, and code transformations to handle these variants within the application at runtime. To avoid GUI duplicates, only GUI variants that are unique, and related to a valid product configuration, are produced. To validate our approach, we implemented tool support to enable this for Android based applications. © 2013 ACM.},

In this work, we propose an interpretation of multi-user configuration as a game theoretic problem. Game theory is a well-known discipline which analyzes conflicts and cooperation among intelligent rational decision-makers. We present a taxonomy of multi-user configuration approaches, and how they can be interpreted as different problems of game theory.

abstract={The automated analysis of feature models (FM) is based on SAT, BDD, and CSP - known NP-complete problems. Therefore, the analysis could have an exponential worst-case execution time. However, for many practical relevant analysis cases, state-of-the-art (SOTA) analysis tools quite successfully master the problem of exponential worst-case execution time based on heuristics. So far, however, very little is known about the structure of FMs that cause the cases in which the execution time (hardness) for analyzing a given FM increases unpredictably for SOTA analysis tools. In this paper, we propose to use width measures from graph theory to characterize the structural complexity of FMs as a basis for an estimation of the hardness of analysis operations on FMs with SOTA analysis tools. We present an experiment that we use to analyze the reasonability of graph width measures as metric for the structural complexity of FMs and the hardness of FM analysis. Such a complexity metric can be used as a basis for a unified method to systematically improve SOTA analysis tools. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Software Product Lines (SPLs) are families of related software products, which usually provide a large number of feature combinations, a fact that poses a unique set of challenges for software testing. Recently, many SPL testing approaches have been proposed, among them pair wise combinatorial techniques that aim at selecting products to test based on the pairs of feature combinations such products provide. These approaches regard SPL testing as an optimization problem where either coverage (maximize) or test suite size (minimize) are considered as the main optimization objective. Instead, we take a multi-objective view where the two objectives are equally important. In this exploratory paper we propose a zero-one mathematical linear program for solving the multi-objective problem and present an algorithm to compute the true Pareto front, hence an optimal solution, from the feature model of a SPL. The evaluation with 118 feature models revealed an interesting trade-off between reducing the number of constraints in the linear program and the runtime which opens up several venues for future research. © 2013 IEEE.},

In contrast to related efforts that describe customization options at the technical level of service description, we propose a Web Services Variability description Language (WSVL) that facilitates the representation of such options at business level. The language has several advantages. Firstly, it does not require people, who perform customization, to have knowledge of Web service technologies. Thus, the language enables business users-friendly service customization. Secondly, the language captures not only what can be customized, but also how and where customization operations should happen in a service-oriented way. This self-described property removes the need for a separate procedure for governing service customization. Consequently, this property eases the adoption of the language. We elaborate the design of the language using a case study and describe its usages from both consumers and providers' viewpoints. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

Since the introduction of FODA in 1990, several variability modeling languages have been proposed in academia and industry, followed by hundreds of research papers on variability models and modeling.

We study the constructs, semantics, usage, and associated tools of two variability modeling languages, Kconfig and CDL, which are independently developed outside academia and used in large and significant software projects. We analyze 128 variability models found in 12 open - source projects using these languages. Our study 1) supports variability modeling research with empirical data on the real-world use of its flagship concepts. However, we 2) also provide requirements for concepts and mechanisms that are not commonly considered in academic techniques, and 3) challenge assumptions about size and complexity of variability models made in academic papers. These results are of interest to researchers working on variability modeling and analysis techniques and to designers of tools, such as feature dependency checkers and interactive product configurators. © 1976-2012 IEEE.},

Variability Models (VMs) can be employed to formulate in a more precise way the semantics of PCMs and enable automated reasoning such as assisted configuration. Yet, the gap between PCMs and VMs should be precisely understood and automated techniques should support the transition between the two. In this paper, we propose variability patterns that describe PCMs content and conduct an empirical analysis of 300+ PCMs mined from Wikipedia.

abstract={The value of software or functionality that is realized using software within modern cars is about 35% of the value of the car itself. We typically have more than 70 ECU in a car with functionality realized and controlled by software. Although most of the current research is focused on software engineering issues, the problems addressed in the software area also occur in the development of mechanical components. Globalization is not limited to software, it also impacts the development departments of OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers) with components requested and produced all over the world. Additionally, variability of hardware components used to customize cars is drastically increasing and can be compared to the variability growth in software. Therefore, the efficient and effective handling of requirements for mechanical parts is one of the key factors for a sustainable success within automobile industry. To be able to cope with the expected complexity, Volkswagen decided to introduce a new product line based requirements management methodology. The paper describes the developed methodology and experience made when introducing such a methodology. © Springer-Verlag London 2013.},

abstract={This paper proposes a holistic modeling approach that combines the capabilities of Object Process Methodology (OPM), Colored Petri Net (CPN), and feature model. The resultant holistic model not only can capture the structural, behavioral, and dynamic aspects of a system, allowing simulation and strong analysis methods to be applied, it can also specify the architectural design space. This modeling approach is developed to facilitate the implementation of search-based system architecting where search algorithms are used to explore design trade space for good architecture alternatives. Such architecting approach integrates certain model construction, alternative generation, simulation, and assessment processes into a coherent and automated framework. Both the proposed holistic modeling approach and the search-based architecting framework are generic. They are targeted at systems that can be specified by conceptual models using object-oriented or process-oriented paradigms. The broad applicability of the proposed approach is demonstrated with the configuration of reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMSs) under multiobjective optimization as an example. The test results showed that the proposed modeling approach could cover a huge number of architecture alternatives and supported the assessment of several performance measures. A set of quality results was obtained after running the optimization algorithm following the proposed search-based architecting framework. © 2013 The authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Software Product Lines (SPLs) are families of related software products. SPL practices have proven substantial technological and economical benefits such as improved software reuse and reduced time to market. Software testing is a key development activity in SPLs, and it is uniquely challenging because of the usually large number of feature combinations present in typical SPLs. Pairwise testing is a combinatorial testing technique that aims at selecting products to test based on the pairs of feature combinations such products provide. Our previous work on evolutionary approaches for SPL testing and their comparative analysis has yielded a large amount of data that prompted us to explore ways by which to convey and represent this information. In this paper we present our early results in this effort. We describe three basic visualization applications to pairwise testing and highlight some of the open questions that we foresee. But most importantly, our driving goal is both to raise the awareness of the visualization problems in this area and to spark the interest of the software visualization community. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The customer oriented individualization of products is getting more and more important for the production industry. Especially in car manufacturing industry we can observe a dramatically increasing number of product variants not only related to different car concepts but also concerning different functionality as for example in car entertainment. In order to cope with this increasing complexity in terms of product features and their interrelationships, manufacturers more and more build on a formal approach called feature modeling that allows for a formal analysis of the specified variability artifacts with the help of specialized proving engines as for example SAT-solvers. The development of such proving engines and their test is quite complicated also due to the fact that manufacturers do not disclose the real development data for understandable reasons. Thus, a framework is needed that enables the proving engine developers to test their engines on nearly real data and to show the potential and possibilities of their engines without having the real development data at hand. This paper presents a framework for generating especially large parameterized feature models used for load testing and benchmarking feature model analysis tools, as well as two usage scenarios: the first one runs a typical benchmark with large feature models on two versions of the theorem prover SPASS, the second shows the integration of the generator in a client-server environment where its functionality is hosted on a website, i.e. using the browser as a frontend working on tablets and modern smartphones. © 2013 The Authors and IOS Press.},

abstract={A Software Product Line is a set of software products that share a number of core properties but also differ in others. Differences and commonalities between products are typically described in terms of features. A software product line is usually modeled with a feature diagram, describing the set of features and specifying the constraints and relationships between these features. Each product is defined as a set of features. In this area of research, a key challenge is to ensure correctness and safety of these products. There is an increasing need for automatic tools that can support feature diagram analysis, particularly with a large number of features that modern software systems may have. In this paper, we propose using model transformations an automatic framework to generate all valid products according to the feature diagram. We first introduce the basic idea behind our approach. Then, we present the used graph grammar to perform automatically this task using the AToM3 tool. Finally, we show the feasibility of our proposal by means of running example. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2013.},

abstract={Modern software systems are constantly increasing in complexity and supporting the rapid prototyping of such systems has become crucial to check the feasibility of extensions and optimizations, thereby reducing risks and, consequently, the cost of development. As modern software systems are also expected to be reused, extended, and adapted over a much longer lifetime than ever before, ensuring the maintainability of such systems is equally gaining relevance. In this paper, we present the development, optimization and maintenance of MoSo-PoLiTe, a framework for Software Product Line (SPL) testing, as a novel case study for rapid prototyping via metamodelling and programmed graph transformations. The first part of the case study evaluates the use of programmed graph transformations for optimizing an existing, hand-written system (MoSo-PoLiTe) via rapid prototyping of various strategies. In the second part, we present a complete re-engineering of the hand-written system with programmed graph transformations and provide a critical comparison of both implementations.Our results and conclusions indicate that metamodelling and programmed graph transformation are not only suitable techniques for rapid prototyping, but also lead to more maintainable systems. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this paper, we propose an approach to realizing SIMT SaaS applications, which is based on Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPL) and supports runtime sharing and variation. With the collaboration among a subset of services as the unit of composition, the commonality among the tenants' requirements is realized in the DSPL architecture by sharing collaboration units, and their variability is realized by composing different collaboration units, all at runtime. In addition, we adopt a feature-based high-level representation of the commonality and variability between the tenants' requirements to facilitate the runtime creation and reconfiguration of their application variants. We compare our approach with two alternative approaches in terms of development effort and degree of sharing. We further quantify the runtime overhead incurred by our multi-tenancy support. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Automated test case selection for a new product in a product line is challenging due to several reasons. First, the variability within the product line needs to be captured in a systematic way; second, the reusable test cases from the repository are required to be identified for testing a new product. The objective of such automated process is to reduce the overall effort for selection (e.g., selection time), while achieving an acceptable level of the coverage of testing functionalities. In this paper, we propose a systematic and automated methodology using a Feature Model for Testing (FM-T) to capture commonalities and variabilities of a product line and a Component Family Model for Testing (CFM-T) to capture the overall structure of test cases in the repository. With our methodology, a test engineer does not need to manually go through the repository to select a relevant set of test cases for a new product. Instead, a test engineer only needs to select a set of relevant features using FM-T at a higher level of abstraction for a product and a set of relevant test cases will be selected automatically. We applied our methodology to a product line of video conferencing systems called Saturn developed by Cisco and the results show that our methodology can reduce the selection effort significantly. Moreover, we conducted a questionnaire-based study to solicit the views of test engineers who were involved in developing FM-T and CFM-T. The results show that test engineers are positive about adapting our methodology and models (FM-T and CFM-T) in their current practice. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Modeling and managing variability is a key activity in a growing number of software engineering contexts. Support for composing variability models is arising in many engineering scenarios, for instance, when several subsystems or modeling artifacts, each coming with their own variability and possibly developed by different stakeholders, should be combined together. In this paper, we consider the problem of composing feature models (FMs), a widely used formalism for representing and reasoning about a set of variability choices. We show that several composition operators can actually be defined, depending on both matching/ merging strategies and semantic properties expected in the composed FM. We present four alternative forms and their implementations. We discuss their relative trade-offs w.r.t. reasoning, customizability, traceability, composability and quality of the resulting feature diagram. We summarize these findings in a reading grid which is validated by revisiting some relevant existing works.

abstract={Context A Software Product Line is a set of software systems that are built from a common set of features. These systems are developed in a prescribed way and they can be adapted to fit the needs of customers. Feature models specify the properties of the systems that are meaningful to customers. A semantics that models the feature level has the potential to support the automatic analysis of entire software product lines. Objective The objective of this paper is to define a formal framework for Software Product Lines. This framework needs to be general enough to provide a formal semantics for existing frameworks like FODA (Feature Oriented Domain Analysis), but also to be easily adaptable to new problems. Method We define an algebraic language, called SPLA, to describe Software Product Lines. We provide the semantics for the algebra in three different ways. The approach followed to give the semantics is inspired by the semantics of process algebras. First we define an operational semantics, next a denotational semantics, and finally an axiomatic semantics. We also have defined a representation of the algebra into propositional logic. Results We prove that the three semantics are equivalent. We also show how FODA diagrams can be automatically translated into SPLA. Furthermore, we have developed our tool, called AT, that implements the formal framework presented in this paper. This tool uses a SAT-solver to check the satisfiability of an SPL. Conclusion This paper defines a general formal framework for software product lines. We have defined three different semantics that are equivalent; this means that depending on the context we can choose the most convenient approach: operational, denotational or axiomatic. The framework is flexible enough because it is closely related to process algebras. Process algebras are a well-known paradigm for which many extensions have been defined. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Context The use of Business Process Management Systems (BPMS) has emerged in the IT arena for the automation of business processes. In the majority of cases, the issue of security is overlooked by default in these systems, and hence the potential cost and consequences of the materialization of threats could produce catastrophic loss for organizations. Therefore, the early selection of security controls that mitigate risks is a real and important necessity. Nevertheless, there exists an enormous range of IT security controls and their configuration is a human, manual, time-consuming and error-prone task. Furthermore, configurations are carried out separately from the organization perspective and involve many security stakeholders. This separation makes difficult to ensure the effectiveness of the configuration with regard to organizational requirements. Objective In this paper, we strive to provide security stakeholders with automated tools for the optimal selection of IT security configurations in accordance with a range of business process scenarios and organizational multi-criteria. Method An approach based on feature model analysis and constraint programming techniques is presented, which enable the automated analysis and selection of optimal security configurations. Results A catalogue of feature models is determined by analyzing typical IT security controls for BPMSs for the enforcement of the standard goals of security: integrity, confidentiality, availability, authorization, and authentication. These feature models have been implemented through constraint programs, and Constraint Programming techniques based on optimized and non-optimized searches are used to automate the selection and generation of configurations. In order to compare the results of the determination of configuration a comparative analysis is given. Conclusion In this paper, we present innovative tools based on feature models, Constraint Programming and multi-objective techniques that enable the agile, adaptable and automatic selection and generation of security configurations in accordance with the needs of the organization. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

For example, this study configures software product lines (expressed as feature maps) using various search-based software engineering methods. As we increase the number of optimization objectives, we find that methods in widespread use (e.g. NSGA-II, SPEA2) perform much worse than IBEA (Indicator-Based Evolutionary Algorithm). IBEA works best since it makes most use of user preference knowledge. Hence it does better on the standard measures (hypervolume and spread) but it also generates far more products with 0% violations of domain constraints. Our conclusion is that we need to change our methods for search-based software engineering, particularly when studying complex decision spaces. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents a novel approach to the design verification of Software Product Lines (SPL). The proposed approach assumes that the requirements and designs at the feature level are modeled as finite state machines with variability information. The variability information at the requirement and design levels are expressed differently and at different levels of abstraction. Also the proposed approach supports verification of SPL in which new features and variability may be added incrementally. Given the design and requirements of an SPL, the proposed design verification method ensures that every product at the design level behaviourally conforms to a product at the requirement level. The conformance procedure is compositional in the sense that the verification of an entire SPL consisting of multiple features is reduced to the verification of the individual features. The method has been implemented and demonstrated in a prototype tool SPLEnD (SPL Engine for Design Verification) on a couple of fairly large case studies. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

In the literature, there are several general-purpose as well as domain-specific proposals for specifying process variability.

abstract={In the context of Model-Based Testing (MBT) of product lines, effort required to develop models can be significantly reduced by applying systematic product line modeling and configuration methodologies. In our previous work, we developed such a methodology to capture variability in configurable UML state machines and aspect state machines. For each product, these state machines are to be configured for generating executable test cases. In this paper, we extended this methodology using Feature Model for Testing (FM-T) and Component Family Model for Behaviors (CFM-B). FM-T captures variable testing functionalities of a product line, whereas CFM-B provides an abstraction layer on top of the configurable state machines. With our current methodology, a test engineer doesn't need to acquire expertise on behavioral modeling and can simply configure models for a product by selecting features in FM-T and configuring provided attributes in CFM-B. The configured models are then given input to our model-based testing tool, TRansformation-based tool for Uml-baSed Testing (TRUST) for executable test case generation. We applied our extended methodology to a product line of video conferencing system developed by Cisco Systems, Norway. Results show that the methodology significantly reduces the complexity of configuration, thereby significantly reducing required effort and cost (e.g., in terms of training). In addition, it does not require test engineers to have expertise in UML modeling, aspect-oriented modeling, and OCL specification and therefore eases the adoption of MBT in industry. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Mobile applications run in environments where the context is continuously changing. Therefore, it is necessary to provide support for the run-time adaptation of these applications. This support is usually achieved by middleware platforms that offer a context-aware dynamic reconfiguration service. However, the main shortcoming of existing approaches is that both the list of possible configurations and the plans to adapt the application to a new configuration are usually specified at design-time. In this paper we present an approach that allows the automatic generation at run-time of application configurations and of reconfiguration plans. Moreover, the generated configurations are optimal regarding the provided functionality and, more importantly, without exceeding the available resources (e.g. battery). This is performed by: (1) having the information about the application variability available at runtime using feature models, and (2) using a genetic algorithm that allows generating an optimal configuration at runtime. We have specified a case study and evaluated our approach, and the results show that it is efficient enough as to be used on mobile devices without introducing an excessive overhead. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Software Product Line Engineering is successfully applied in the development of families of related products. Basically, it allows reusing the software artifacts that are common to all the products, and adding/removing the variable ones. There are two alternatives to manage variability, one that models the commonalities and variabilities separately from the software product line architecture (SPLA), using, for instance, feature models (FM), and another one that models the variability as part of the SPLA. These two alternatives have both benefits and limitations. Our approach picks the best of both alternatives and, on the one hand, models variability as part of the SPLA (as in the second alternative), but, on the other hand, maps the SPLA with variability into an FM, generating an Architectural FM. By doing this our approach takes advantage of the FM tools and formal reasoning (as in the first alternative) to provide the automatic support that it is not available in other SPLA with variability approaches to: (i) check the consistency of architectural variability specifications, (ii) generate valid architectural configurations, and (iii) reason about variability at the architectural level. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Consequently, these approaches cannot address the situation when a customizable composite service is orchestrated from partner services which themselves are customizable. In this article, we describe a feature-based approach that is able to effectively model variability within and across compositions.

abstract={Identifying which part of a local system should be migrated to a public Cloud environment is often a difficult and error prone process. With the significant (and increasing) number of commercial Cloud providers, choosing a provider whose capability best meets requirements is also often difficult. Most Cloud service providers offer large amounts of configurable resources, which can be combined in a number of different ways. In the case of small and medium companies, finding a suitable configuration with the minimum cost is often an essential requirement to migrate, or even to initiate the decision process for migration. We interpret this need as a problem associated with variability management and analysis. Variability techniques and models deal with large configuration spaces, and have been proposed previously to support configuration processes in industrial cases. Furthermore, this is a mature field which has a large catalog of analysis operations to extract valuable information in an automated way. Some of these operations can be used and tailored for Cloud environments. We focus in this work on Amazon Cloud services, primarily due to the large number of possible configurations available by this service provider and its popularity. Our approach can also be adapted to other providers offering similar capabilities.},

abstract={Industrial variability models tend to grow in size and complexity due to ever-increasing functionality and complexity of software systems. Some authors report on variability models specifying several thousands of variabilities. However, traditional variability modeling approaches do not seem to scale adequately to cope with size and complexity of such models. Recently, textual variability modeling languages have been advocated as one scalable solution. In this paper, we provide a systematic analysis of the capabilities of current textual variability modeling languages, in particular regarding variability management in the large. Towards this aim, we define a classification schema consisting of five dimensions, classify ten different textual variability modeling languages using the classification schema and provide an analysis. In summary, some textual variability modeling languages go beyond textual representations of traditional variability modeling approaches and provide sophisticated modeling concepts and constraint languages. Three textual variability modeling approaches already support mechanisms for large-scale variability modeling such as model composition, modularization, or evolution support. © 2013 ACM.},

In such a case, cardinality-based feature models are used to specify the number of clones for a given feature. Although previous works already investigated approaches for feature modeling with cardinality, there is still a lack of support for constraints in the presence of clones. To overcome this limitation, we present an abstract model to define constraints in cardinality-based feature models and propose a formal semantics for this kind of constraints. We illustrate the practical usage of our approach with examples from our recent experiences on cloud computing platform configuration. © 2013 ACM.},

abstract={Software Products Lines (SPLs) are families of products sharing common assets representing code or functionalities of a software product. These assets are represented as features, usually organized into Feature Models (FMs) from which the user can configure software products. Generally, few features are sufficient to allow configuring millions of software products. As a result, selecting the products matching given testing objectives is a difficult problem. The testing process usually involves multiple and potentially conflicting testing objectives to fulfill, e.g. maximizing the number of optional features to test while at the same time both minimizing the number of products and minimizing the cost of testing them. However, most approaches for generating products usually target a single objective, like testing the maximum amount of feature interactions. While focusing on one objective may be sufficient in certain cases, this practice does not reflect real-life testing situations. The present paper proposes a genetic algorithm to handle multiple conflicting objectives in test generation for SPLs. Experiments conducted on FMs of different sizes demonstrate the effectiveness, feasibility and practicality of the introduced approach. © 2013 ACM.},

abstract={Model-based Software Product Line (MSPL) engineering aims at deriving customized models corresponding to individual products of a family. MSPL approaches usually promote the joint use of a variability model, a base model expressed in a specific formalism, and a realization layer that maps variation points to model elements. The design space of an MSPL is extremely complex to manage for the engineer, since the number of variants may be exponential and the derived product models have to be conformant to numerous well-formedness and business rules. In this paper, the objective is to provide a way to generate MSPLs, called counterexamples, that can produce invalid product models despite a valid configuration in the variability model. We provide a systematic and automated process, based on the Common Variability Language (CVL), to randomly search the space of MSPLs for a specific formalism. We validate the effectiveness of this process for three formalisms at different scales (up to 247 metaclasses and 684 rules). We also explore and discuss how counterexamples could guide practitioners when customizing derivation engines, when implementing checking rules that prevent early incorrect CVL models, or simply when specifying an MSPL. © 2013 ACM.},

abstract={Feature Models (FMs) are used extensively in software product line engineering to help generate and validate individual product configurations and to provide support for domain analysis. As FM construction can be tedious and time-consuming, researchers have previously developed techniques for extracting FMs from sets of formally specified individual configurations, or from software requirements specifications for families of existing products. However, such artifacts are often not available. In this paper we present a novel, automated approach for constructing FMs from publicly available product descriptions found in online product repositories and marketing websites such as SoftPedia and CNET. While each individual product description provides only a partial view of features in the domain, a large set of descriptions can provide fairly comprehensive coverage. Our approach utilizes hundreds of partial product descriptions to construct an FM and is described and evaluated against antivirus product descriptions mined from SoftPedia.},

Test generation from feature models, i.e. generating a valid and representative subset of all the possible product configurations, is still an open challenge. A common approach is to build combinatorial interaction test suites, for instance achieving pair wise coverage among the features. In this paper we show how standard feature models can be translated to combinatorial interaction models in our framework CitLab, with all the advantages of having a combinatorial testing environment (in terms of a clear semantics, editing facilities, language for seeds and test goals, and generation algorithms). We present our translation which gives a precise semantics to feature models and it tries to minimize the number of parameter and constraints while preserving the original semantics of the feature model. Experiments show the advantages of our approach. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Needs for mass customization and economies of scale have pushed engineers to develop Software Product Lines (SPLs). SPLs are families of products sharing commonalities and exhibiting differences, built by reusing software assets abstractly represented by features. Feature models describe the constraints that link the features and allow the configuration of tailored software products. Common SPLs involve hundreds, even thousands of features, leading to billions of possible software products. As a result, testing a product line is challenging due to the enormous size of the possible products. Existing techniques focus on testing based on the product line's feature model by selecting a limited set of products to test. Being created manually or reverse-engineered, feature models are prone to errors impacting the generated test suites. In this paper, we examine ability of test suites to detect such errors. In particular, we propose two mutation operators to derive erroneous feature models (mutants) from an original feature model and assess the capability of the generated original test suite to kill the mutants. Experimentation on real feature models demonstrate that dissimilar tests suites have a higher mutant detection ability than similar ones, thus validating the relevance of similarity-driven product line testing. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Test minimization techniques aim at identifying and eliminating redundant test cases from test suites in order to reduce the total number of test cases to execute, thereby improving the efficiency of testing. In the context of software product line, we can save effort and cost in the selection and minimization of test cases for testing a specific product by modeling the product line. However, minimizing the test suite for a product requires addressing two potential issues: 1) the minimized test suite may not cover all test requirements compared with the original suite; 2) the minimized test suite may have less fault revealing capability than the original suite. In this paper, we apply weight-based Genetic Algorithms (GAs) to minimize the test suite for testing a product, while preserving fault detection capability and testing coverage of the original test suite. The challenge behind is to define an appropriate fitness function, which is able to preserve the coverage of complex testing criteria (e.g., Combinatorial Interaction Testing criterion). Based on the defined fitness function, we have empirically evaluated three different weight-based GAs on an industrial case study provided by Cisco Systems, Inc. Norway. We also presented our results of applying the three weight-based GAs on five existing case studies from the literature. Based on these case studies, we conclude that among the three weight-based GAs, Random-Weighted GA (RWGA) achieved significantly better performance than the other ones. Copyright © 2013 ACM.},

abstract={The need for flexible customization of large feature-rich software systems, according to requirements of various stakeholders, has become an important problem in software development. Among the many software engineering approaches dealing with variability management, the notion of Software Product Line (SPL) has emerged as a major unifying concept. Drawing from established disciplines of manufacturing, SPL approaches aim to design repertoires of software artifacts, from which customized software systems for specific stakeholder requirements can be developed. A major difficulty SPL approaches attempt to address is the modularization of software artifacts, which reconciles the user's needs for certain features and the development and technical constraints. Towards this end, many SPL approaches use feature diagrams to describe possible configurations of a feature set. There have been several proposals for feature diagram languages with varying degrees of expressiveness, intuitiveness, and precision. However, these feature diagram languages have limited scalability when applied to realistic software systems. This article provides a systematic survey of various concerns of feature diagrams and ways in which concerns have been separated. The survey shows how the uncertainty in the purpose of feature diagram languages creates both conceptual and practical limitations to scalability of those languages. © 2013 ACM.},

We propose a technique to specify concerns in feature diagrams and to generate automatically concern-specific configuration views. Three alternative visualisations are proposed. Our contributions are motivated and illustrated through excerpts from a real web-based meeting management application which was also used for a preliminary evaluation.

abstract={In a Software Product Line (SPL), a feature model is widely used to represent the commonalities and variabilities of a family of software products. In the process of establishing feature models, the incorrect and inaccurate feature relationships will lead to feature model errors which prevent the effective product configuration. The feature model validation aims to identify the errors existing in a feature model and find the solutions of resolving the errors. The current validation approaches transformed a feature model into a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) and used off-the-shelf solvers to reason on the CSP. However, the use of solvers might take an infeasible amount of time for validating large scale feature models, as CSP exhibits the exponential complexity and requires a combination of heuristics and combinational search methods. This study developed an efficient validation approach based on the contradictory feature relationships behind the errors. As the contradictory feature relationships were found based on feature relationship propagation, the solvers were not required by this approach. The performance and correctness of this proposed approach were evaluated by comparing with the CSP based approach based on a set of predesigned feature models and a number of large-scale feature models. © 2013 Academic Journals Inc.},

Objective: Our main objective is to determine whether, with the use of modeling tools, we can simplify and automate the definition process of a SPL, improving the selection process of reusable assets. Method: We developed a model-driven strategy based on the identification of critical points (sensitivity points) inside the SPL architecture. This strategy automatically selects the components that appropriately match the product's functional and quality requirements. We validated our approach experimenting with different real configuration and derivation scenarios in a mobile healthcare SPL where we have worked during the last three years. Results: Through our SPL experiment, we established that our approach improved in nearly 98% the selection of reusable assets when compared with the unassisted analysis selection. However, using our approach there is an increment in the time required for the configuration corresponding to the learning curve of the proposed tools. Conclusion: We can conclude that our domain-specific modeling approach significantly improves the software architect's decision making when selecting the most suitable combinations of reusable components in the context of a SPL. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Second, we are able to model dependencies between different software product lines in a multi-product-line scenario. To ensure consistency and correctness of DFMs, we have to apply analyses, such as dead-feature detection. We discuss why DFMs challenge the detection of inconsistencies, present how to reuse existing analyses for DFMs, and propose new analyses to supplement existing ones.

An important part of this type of testing is determining a subset of SPL products in which interaction errors are more likely to occur. Such sets of products are obtained by computing a so called t-wise Covering Array (tCA), whose computation is known to be NP-complete. Recently, the ICPL algorithm has been proposed to compute these covering arrays. In this research-in-progress paper, we propose a set of rules that exploit basic feature model knowledge to reduce the number of elements (i.e. t-sets) required by ICPL without weakening the strength of the generated arrays. We carried out a comparison of runtime performance that shows a significant reduction of the needed execution time for the majority of our SPL case studies. © 2013 ACM.},

abstract={Software product-line engineering aims at developing families of related products that share common assets to provide customers with tailor-made products. Customers are often interested not only in particular functionalities (i.e., features), but also in non-functional quality attributes, such as performance, reliability, and footprint. Measuring quality attributes of all products of a product line usually does not scale. In this research-in-progress report, we propose a systematic approach aiming at efficient and scalable prediction of quality attributes of products. To this end, we establish predictors for certain categories of quality attributes (e.g., a predictor for high memory consumption) based on software and network measures, and receiver operating characteristic analysis. We use these predictors to guide a sampling process that takes the assets of a product line as input and determines the products that fall into the category denoted by the given predictor (e.g., products with high memory consumption). We propose to use predictors to make the process of finding "acceptable" products more efficient. We discuss and compare several strategies to incorporate predictors in the sampling process. © 2013 ACM.},

abstract={Due to increase in market competition and merger and acquisition of companies, different software product lines (SPLs) may exist under the same roof. These SPLs may be developed applying different domain analysis processes, but are likely not disjoint. Cross product line analysis aims to examine the common and variable aspects of different SPLs for improving maintenance and future development of related SPLs. Currently different SPL artifacts, or more accurately feature models, are compared, matched, and merged for supporting scalability, increasing modularity and reuse, synchronizing feature model versions, and modeling multiple SPLs for software supply chains. However, in all these cases the focus is on creating valid merged models from the input feature models. Furthermore, the terminology used in all the input feature models is assumed to be the same, namely similar features are named the same. As a result these methods cannot be simply applied to feature models that represent different SPLs. In this work we offer adapting similarity metrics and text clustering techniques in order to enable cross product line analysis. This way analysis of feature models that use different terminologies in the same domain can be done in order to improve the management of the involved SPLs. Preliminary results reveal that the suggested method helps systematically analyze the commonality and variability between related SPLs, potentially suggesting improvements to existing SPLs and to the maintenance of sets of SPLs. © 2013 ACM.},

In essence, FMs aim to define a set of valid combinations of features, also called configurations. In this paper, we tackle the problem of synthesising an FM from a set of configurations. The main challenge is that numerous candidate FMs can be extracted from the same input configurations, yet only a few of them are meaningful and maintainable. We first characterise the different meanings of FMs and identify the key properties allowing to discriminate between them. We then develop a generic synthesis procedure capable of restituting the intended meanings of FMs based on inferred or user-specified knowledge.

abstract={Decision models are widely used in software engineering to describe and restrict decision-making (e.g., deriving a product from a product-line). Since decisions are typically interdependent, it is often neither obvious which decisions have the most significant impact nor which decisions might ultimately conflict. Unfortunately, the current state-of-the-art provides little support for dealing with such situations. On the one hand, some conflicts can be avoided by providing more freedom in which order decisions are made (i.e., most important decisions first). On the other hand, conflicts are unavoidable at times, and living with conflicts may be preferable over forcing the user to fix them right away - particularly because fixing conflicts becomes easier as more is known about a user's intentions. This paper introduces the C2O (Configurator 2.0) tool for guided decision-making. The tool allows the user to answer questions in an arbitrary order - with and without the presence of inconsistencies. While giving users those freedoms, it still supports and guides them by (i) rearranging the order of questions according to their potential to minimize user input, (ii) providing guidance to avoid follow-on conflicts, and (iii) supporting users in fixing conflicts at a later time. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={A key aspect in any process-oriented organisation is the evaluation of process performance for the achievement of its strategic and operational goals. Process Performance Indicators (PPIs) are a key asset to carry out this evaluation, and, therefore, having an appropriate definition of these PPIs is crucial. After a careful review of the literature related and a study of the current picture in different real organisations, we conclude that there not exists any proposal that allows to define PPIs in a way that is unambiguous and highly expressive, understandable by technical and non-technical users and traceable with the Business Process (BP). In addition, like other activities carried out during the BP lifecycle, the management of PPIs is considered time-consuming and error-prone. Therefore, providing an automated support for them is very appealing from a practical point of view. In this paper, we propose the PPINOT metamodel, which allows such an advanced definition of PPIs and is independent of the language used to model the business process. Furthermore, we provide an automatic semantic mapping from the metamodel to Description Logics (DL) that allows the implementation of design-time analysis operations in such a way that DL reasoners' facilities can be leveraged. These operations provide information that can assist process analysts in the definition and instrumentation of PPIs. Finally, to validate the usefulness of our proposal, we have used the PPINOT metamodel at the core of a software tool called the PPINOT Tool Suite and we have applied it in several real scenarios. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

A key challenge is to determine the configuration most suitable, especially with respect to non-functional aspects: quality of service, performance, reconfiguration time. We propose an algorithm for selecting the configuration that optimizes a given quality metrics. This algorithm is a variant of the Best-First Search algorithm, a heuristic technique suitable for feature model optimization. The algorithm is parameterized with several strategies and heuristics on feature models leading to different optimality and efficiency properties.

abstract={Software Product Lines (SPLs) enable software reuse by systematically managing commonalities and variability. Usually, commonalities and variability are expressed by features. Functional requirements of a software product are met by selecting appropriate features. However, selecting features also influences non-functional properties. To satisfy non-functional requirements of a software product, as well, the effect of a feature selection on non-functional properties has to be known. Often an SPL allows a vast number of valid products, which renders a test of non-functional properties on the basis of all valid products impractical. Recent research offers a solution to this problem: the effect of features on non-functional properties of software products is predicted by measuring in advance. A sample of feature configurations is generated, executed with a predefined benchmark, and then non-functional properties are measured. Based on these data a model is created that allows to predict non-functional properties of a software product before actually building it. However, in some domains contextual influences, such as input data, can heavily affect nonfunctional properties. We argue that the measurement of the effect of features on non-functional properties can be drastically improved by considering contextual influences of a domain. We study this assumption on input data as an example for a contextual influence and using an artificial but intuitive case study from the domain of compression algorithms. Our study shows that prediction accuracy of non-functional properties can be significantly improved.},

Due to the increasing size and complexity of feature models, anomalies in terms of inconsistencies and redundancies can occur which lead to increased efforts related to feature model development and maintenance. In this paper we introduce knowledge representations which serve as a basis for the explanation of anomalies in feature models. On the basis of these representations we show how explanation algorithms can be applied. The results of a performance analysis show the applicability of these algorithms for anomaly detection in feature models. We conclude the paper with a discussion of future research issues.},

abstract={In the context of Model-Based Engineering (MBE) of product lines, effort required to develop models can be significantly reduced by applying systematic product line modeling and configuration methodologies. Our previous work presented models of bCMS developed using AspectSM, a UML profile for Aspect-Oriented Modeling (AOM), which was defined to model crosscutting behaviors using extended UML state machines, with the objectives of minimizing modeling effort and the learning curve for modeling crosscutting behavior. However, such approach still requires users to be familiar with specific expertise and concepts on various UML behavior models. In this paper, we extend our previous work using Feature Model (FM) and Component Family Model (CFM) to model bCMS product line. More specifically, a FM is designed and developed to capture all variations points for bCMS product line and a CFM is built to provide an abstraction layer on top of the configurable state machines. With our current methodology, a user doesn't need to acquire expertise on behavioral modeling and can simply configure models for a product by selecting features in FM and configuring provided attributes in CFM.},

abstract={Permission-based security models are common in smartphone operating systems. Such models implement access control for sensitive APIs, introducing an additional concern for application developers. It is important for the correct set of permissions to be declared for an application, as too small a set is likely to result in runtime errors, whereas too large a set may needlessly worry users. Unfortunately, not all platform vendors provide tools support to assist in determining the set of permissions that an application requires. We present a language-based solution for permission management. It entails the specification of permission information within a collection of source code, and allows for the inference of permission requirements for a chosen program composition. Our implementation is based on Magnolia, a programming language demonstrating characteristics that are favorable for this use case. A language with a suitable component system supports permission management also in a cross-platform codebase, allowing abstraction over different platform-specific implementations and concrete permission requirements. When the language also requires any "wiring" of components to be known at compile time, and otherwise makes design tradeoffs that favor ease of static analysis, then accurate inference of permission requirements becomes possible. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

Based on two student projects resulting in two cycle computers, the migration to a cycle computer product line is presented, analyzed as well as compared with the industrial experiences available so far. The results of this analysis are lessons learned on the technical side and challenges of the organizational migration facets.

abstract={The Cisco Video Conferencing Systems (VCS) Product Line is composed of many distinct products that can be configured in many different ways. The validation of this product line is currently performed manually during test plan design and test executions' scheduling. For example, the testing of a specific VCS product leads to the manual selection of a set of test cases to be executed and scheduled, depending on the functionalities that are available on the product. In this paper, we develop an alternative approach where the variability of the VCS Product Line is captured by a feature model, while the variability within the set of test cases is captured by a component family model. Using the well-known pure::variants tool approach that establishes links between those two models through restrictions, we can obtain relevant test cases automatically for the testing of a new VCS product. The novelty in this paper lies in the design of a large component family model that organizes a complex test cases structure. We envision a large gain in terms of man-power when a new product is issued and needs to be tested before being marketed. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Software Product Line Engineering aims to ensure the correctness, completeness and consistency among its artifacts and the specified domain, in order to prevent the spread of defects for the products derived from this domam. Among initial artifacts of a software product line, feature models are artifacts generated in various domain engineering approaches. Although software inspection is highlighted as an effective review activity for detection of defects in software artifacts, mainly in the early models of software projects, a recent quasi-systematic review of literature indicated a lack of techniques to support the inspection of software product line artifacts, which include features models. Thus, this paper presents FMCheck, a checklist-based inspection technique to support the detection of defects on feature models. This technique was developed to be configurable and to be applied on several extensions of the original feature model notation presented by FODA approach, including the Odyssey-FEX notation, in particular. FMCheck was submitted to a proof of concept and to a further in vitro feasibility study, in which it could be seen the feasibility of FMCheck application and also that inspections applying FMCheck are more effective than ad-hoc inspections, when applied on four distinct domains. ©2012 IEEE.},

To migrate software products that deemed similar into a product line, it is essential to trace variability among software artifacts because the distinguishing factor between traditional software engineering and software product line engineering is the variability. Variability tracing is used to support conversion from traditional software development into software product line development and automate products derivation process such that core assets can be automatically configured for a product according to the features selection from the feature model. Tracing and maintaining interrelationships between artifacts within a software system also are needed to facilitate program comprehension, make the process of maintaining the system less dependent on individual experts.

abstract={Module systems enable a divide and conquer strategy to software development. To implement compile-time variability in software product lines, modules can be composed in different combinations. However, this way, variability dictates a dominant decomposition. As an alternative, we introduce a variability-aware module system that supports compile-time variability inside a module and its interface. So, each module can be considered a product line that can be type checked in isolation. Variability can crosscut multiple modules. The module system breaks with the antimodular tradition of a global variability model in product-line development and provides a path toward software ecosystems and product lines of product lines developed in an open fashion. We discuss the design and implementation of such a module system on a core calculus and provide an implementation for C as part of the TypeChef project. Our implementation supports variability inside modules from #ifdef preprocessor directives and variable linking at the composition level. With our implementation, we type check all configurations of all modules of the open source product line Busybox with 811 compile-time options, perform linker check of all configurations, and report found type and linker errors - without resorting to a brute-force strategy.},

abstract={The selection among Cloud services is a recent problem in research and practice. The diversity of decision-relevant criteria, configurability of Cloud services and the need to involve human decisionmakers require holistic support through models, methodologies and tools. Existing Cloud service selection approaches do not address all stated difficulties at the same time. We present an approach to capture capabilities of Cloud services and requirements using variability modeling. We use Cloud feature models (CFMs) as a representation mechanism and describe how they are utilized for requirements elicitation and filtering within a presented Cloud service selection process (CSSP) that includes human decision-makers. Filtering produces a reduced number of valid Cloud service configurations that can be further assessed with current multi-criteria decision making-based selection approaches. We present software tools that we use to demonstrate the applicability of our approach in a use case about selecting among Cloud storage services. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.},

Maintaining families of these systems to address issues with the crosscutting concerns, such as security concerns, is recognised to be tedious and costly. To tackle the above problem, we adapt the aspect-oriented paradigm to feature-modeling. One of the most serious problems in aspect-oriented modeling is the potential of taking a valid model and spoiling its validity when weaving an aspect to it. We present a formal verification technique of aspectual composition in the context of feature-modeling that is based on product family algebra. We define a set of validity criteria for aspects with regard to their corresponding base specifications.

abstract={Software product lines, usually described using feature models, have proven to be a feasible solution to develop mobile and context-aware applications. These applications use con- text information to provide services and data for their users from anywhere and at any time. However, building feature models for mobile and context-aware software product lines demands advanced skills of software engineers, since it comprises system and context information. Moreover, to guarantee a correct application execution, these models must be thoroughly specified, composed and verified to check whether some composition and adaptation rules are violated. Although this is an important task, there is a lack of formalization of such rules, which makes it difficult to use those rules for feature models verification. In this paper, we propose an approach to prevent defects in context-aware feature models and in their product reconfiguration based on formal methods. To validate our work, we developed a prototype to check the correctness of context-aware feature models. Copyright 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Domain feature models concisely express commonality and variability among variants of a software product line. For supporting separation of concerns, e.g., due to legal restrictions, technical considerations and business requirements, multi-view approaches restrict the configuration choices on feature models for different stakeholders. However, recent approaches lack a formalization for precise, yet flexible specifications of views that ensure every derivable configuration perspective to obey feature model semantics. Here, we introduce a novel approach for preconfiguring feature models to create multi-perspectives. Such customized perspectives result from composition of various concern-relevant views. A structured view model is used to organize features in view groups, wherein a feature may be contained in multiple views. We provide formalizations for view composition and guaranteed consistency of perspectives w.r.t. feature model semantics. Thereupon, an efficient algorithm to verify consistency for entire multi-perspectives is provided. We present an implementation and evaluate our concepts by means of various experiments. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

Such architectures often emerge from legacy code, but, unfortunately creating feature models from large, legacy systems is a long and arduous task. We address the problem of automatic synthesis of feature models from propositional constraints. We show that this problem is NP-hard. We design efficient techniques for synthesis of models from respectively CNF and DNF formulas, showing a 10- to 1000-fold performance improvement over known techniques for realistic benchmarks. Our algorithms are the first known techniques that are efficient enough to be applied to dependencies extracted from real systems, opening new possibilities of creating reverse engineering and model management tools for variability models.

abstract={In a Software Product Line (SPL), the central notion of implementability provides the requisite connection between specifications (feature sets) and their implementations (component sets), leading to the definition of products. While it appears to be a simple extension (to sets) of the traceability relation between components and features, it actually involves several subtle issues which are overlooked in the definitions in existing literature. In this paper, we give a precise and formal definition of implementability over a fairly expressive traceability relation to solve these issues. The consequent definition of products in the given SPL naturally entails a set of useful analysis problems that are either refinements of known problems, or are completely novel. We also propose a new approach to solve these analysis problems by encoding them as Quantified Boolean Formula(QBF) and solving them through Quantified Satisfiability (QSAT) solvers. The methodology scales much better than the SAT-based solutions hinted in the literature and is demonstrated through a prototype tool called SPLANE (SPL Analysis Engine), on a couple of fairly large case studies.

abstract={Software Product Lines (SPL) have largely been taken on board by industry. Several reports from large companies such as Bosch, Nokia, Philips and Siemens witness gains and benefits achieved with their use, especially with respect to the reduction on time to market. In SPL development, domain analysis plays a central role where the relevant features are identified. Feature-Oriented Domain Analysis is a method which uses a feature model to specify variabilities and commonalities of an SPL. However, activities related to the Domain Analysis process (managing commonalities and variabilities, with users visibility and relevant stakeholders) in most cases, do not seem to be a simple and easy activity, since to represent these analyzes in modelling domain tools with a certain degree of formality, requires a technical knowledge that domain experts do not always have it prior to use. But creative requirements techniques have been suggested to facilitate the elicitation activity by filling the gap the communications problems between domain experts and software engineers, making the domain analysis more agile. Thus, to improve the domain analysis process, this paper seeks to set out the use of a creative and agile technique for modelling requirements by means of mind maps for cognitive and effective support when building feature models.

Given the nature of Software Product Lines (SPL), the importance of requirements engineering is more pronounced as SPLs pose more complex challenges than development of a 'single' product. Several methods have been proposed in the literature, which encompass activities for capturing requirements, their variability and commonality. To investigate the maturity and effectiveness of the current requirements engineering approaches in software product lines, we develop an evaluation framework containing a set of evaluation criteria and assess feature oriented requirements engineering methods based on the proposed criteria. As a result of this initial study, we find out the majority of approaches lacks proper techniques for supporting the validation of family requirements models as well as dealing with delta requirements. Additionally, capturing stakeholders' preferences and applying them during the course of software feature configuration have not been taken into account and addressed in the proposed approaches.

abstract={Business calculations like break-even, return on investment, or cost are essential in many domains to support decision making while configuring products. For instance, customers and sales people need to estimate and compare the business value of different product variants. Some product line approaches provide initial support, e.g., by defining quality attributes in relation to features. However, an approach that allows domain engineers to easily define business calculations together with variability models is still lacking. In product configuration, calculation results need to be instantly presented to end users after making configuration choices. Further, due to the often high number of calculations, the presentation of calculation results to end users can be challenging. These challenges cannot be addressed by integrating off-the-shelf applications performing the calculations with product line tools. We thus present an approach based on dedicated calculation models that are related to variability models. Our approach seamlessly integrates business calculations with product configuration and provides support for formatting calculations and calculation results. We use the DOPLER tool suite to deploy calculations together with variability models to end users in product configuration. We evaluate the expressiveness and practical relevance of the approach by investigating the development of business calculations for 15 product lines from the domain of industrial automation.

abstract={Formal verification of variant requirements has gained much interest in the software product line (SPL) community. Feature diagrams are widely used to model product line variants. However, there is a lack of precisely defined formal notation for representing and verifying such models. This paper presents an approach to modeling and analyzing SPL variant feature diagrams using first-order logic. It provides a precise and rigorous formal interpretation of the feature diagrams. Logical expressions can be built by modeling variants and their dependencies by using propositional connectives. These expressions can then be validated by any suitable verification tool such as Alloy. A case study of a Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system variant feature model is presented to illustrate the analysis and verification process. Copyright 2012 ACM.},

Next, we define restrictions inside every level as well as between the levels to fully characterize an HBT software product. To limit the impact on the organization development process, we use an extractive approach. This allows us to design core assets starting from current software artifacts.

abstract={Variable Data Printing solutions provide means to generate documents whose content varies according to some criteria. Since the early Mail Merge-like applications that generated letters with destination data taken from databases, different languages and frameworks have been developed with increasing levels of sophistication. Current tools allow the generation of highly customized documents that are variable not only in content, but also in layout. However, most frameworks are technology-oriented, and their use requires high skills in implementation-related tools (XML, XPATH, and others), which do not include support for domain-related tasks like identification of document content variability. In this paper, we introduce DPLfw, a framework for variable content document generation based on Software Product Line Engineering principles. It is an implementation of the Document Product Lines (DPL) approach, which was defined with the aim of supporting variable content document generation from a domain-oriented point of view. DPL models document content variability in terms of features, and product line-like processes support the generation of documents. We define the DPLfw architecture, and illustrate its use in the definition of variable-content emergency plans. Copyright © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Successful software evolves, more and more commonly, from a single system to a set of system variants tailored to meet the similiar and yet different functionality required by the distinct clients and users. Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) is a software development paradigm that has proven effective for coping with this scenario. At the core of SPLE is variability modeling which employs Feature Models (FMs) as the de facto standard to represent the combinations of features that distinguish the systems variants. Reverse engineering FMs consist in constructing a feature model from a set of products descriptions. This research area is becoming increasingly active within the SPLE community, where the problem has been addressed with different perspectives and approaches ranging from analysis of configuration scripts, use of propositional logic or natural language techniques, to ad hoc algorithms. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) to synthesize FMs from the feature sets that describe the system variants. We analyzed 59 representative case studies of different characteristics and complexity. Our exploratory study found that FMs that denote proper supersets of the desired feature sets can be obtained with a small number of generations. However, reducing the differences between these two sets with an effective and scalable fitness function remains an open question. We believe that this work is a first step towards leveraging the extensive wealth of Search-Based Software Engineering techniques to address this and other variability management challenges. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Module systems enable a divide and conquer strategy to software development. To implement compile-time variability in software product lines, modules can be composed in different combinations. However, this way, variability dictates a dominant decomposition. As an alternative, we introduce a variability-aware module system that supports compile-time variability inside a module and its interface. So, each module can be considered a product line that can be type checked in isolation. Variability can crosscut multiple modules. The module system breaks with the antimodular tradition of a global variability model in product-line development and provides a path toward software ecosystems and product lines of product lines developed in an open fashion. We discuss the design and implementation of such a module system on a core calculus and provide an implementation for C as part of the TypeChef project. Our implementation supports variability inside modules from #ifdef preprocessor directives and variable linking at the composition level. With our implementation, we type check all configurations of all modules of the open source product line Busybox with 811 compile-time options, perform linker check of all configurations, and report found type and linker errors - without resorting to a brute-force strategy.

abstract={Due to differences in consumer requirements, a Web service usually has multiple service variants for use in different business contexts. In such situations, delivering customizable services helps increase efficiency not only in service description and publication but also in service consumption. However, existing approaches for providing customizable services enforce the tight coupling between providers and consumers. Nor do they take into account recursive nature of service customization. Consequently, the approaches hamper the widespread use of customizable services in SOA. In this paper, we propose a language, namely Web Service Variability Description Language (WSVL), which formalizes the customization interface between providers and consumers using the XML technology to address these problems. We also describe a reference architecture for service deployment and a service engineering technique which together support the provisioning of WSVL-based customizable services. A proof-of-concept prototype system is introduced to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Software product line engineering is about producing a set of similar products in a certain domain. A variability model documents the variability amongst products in a product line. The specification of variability can be extended with quality information, such as measurable quality attributes (e. g., CPU and memory consumption) and constraints on these attributes (e. g., memory consumption should be in a range of values). However, the wrong use of constraints may cause anomalies in the specification which must be detected (e. g., the model could represent no products). Furthermore, based on such quality information, it is possible to carry out quality-aware analyses, i. e., the product line engineer may want to verify whether it is possible to build a product that satisfies a desired quality. The challenge for quality-aware specification and analysis is threefold. First, there should be a way to specify quality information in variability models. Second, it should be possible to detect anomalies in the variability specification associated with quality information. Third, there should be mechanisms to verify the variability model to extract useful information, such as the possibility to build a product that fulfils certain quality conditions (e. g., is there any product that requires less than 512 MB of memory?). In this article, we present an approach for quality-aware analysis in software product lines using the orthogonal variability model (OVM) to represent variability. We propose to map variability represented in the OVM associated with quality information to a constraint satisfaction problem and to use an off-the-shelf constraint programming solver to automatically perform the verification task. To illustrate our approach, we use a product line in the automotive domain which is an example that was created in a national project by a leading car company. We have developed a prototype tool named FaMa-OVM, which works as a proof of concepts. We were able to identify void models, dead and false optional elements, and check whether the product line example satisfies quality conditions. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Software Product Lines (SPL) are difficult to validate due to combinatorics induced by variability, which in turn leads to combinatorial explosion of the number of derivable products. Exhaustive testing in such a large products space is hardly feasible. Hence, one possible option is to test SPLs by generating test configurations that cover all possible t feature interactions (t-wise). It dramatically reduces the number of test products while ensuring reasonable SPL coverage. In this paper, we report our experience on applying t-wise techniques for SPL with two independent toolsets developed by the authors. One focuses on generality and splits the generation problem according to strategies. The other emphasizes providing efficient generation. To evaluate the respective merits of the approaches, measures such as the number of generated test configurations and the similarity between them are provided. By applying these measures, we were able to derive useful insights for pairwise and t-wise testing of product lines. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={The development of scientific workflows is evolving toward the systematic use of service-oriented architectures, enabling the composition of dedicated and highly parameterized software services into processing pipelines. Building consistent workflows then becomes a cumbersome and error-prone activity as users cannot manage such large-scale variability. This paper presents a rigorous and tooled approach in which techniques from Software Product Line (SPL) engineering are reused and extended to manage variability in service and workflow descriptions. Composition can be facilitated while ensuring consistency. Services are organized in a rich catalog which is organized as a SPL and structured according to the common and variable concerns captured for all services. By relying on sound merging techniques on the feature models that make up the catalog, reasoning about the compatibility between connected services is made possible. Moreover, an entire workflow is then seen as a multiple SPL (i. e., a composition of several SPLs). When services are configured within, the propagation of variability choices is then automated with appropriate techniques and the user is assisted in obtaining a consistent workflow. The approach proposed is completely supported by a combination of dedicated tools and languages. Illustrations and experimental validations are provided using medical imaging pipelines, which are representative of current scientific workflows in many domains. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Domain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs) are the essence of MDE. A DSML describes the concepts of a particular domain in a metamodel, as well as their relationships. Using a DSML, it is possible to describe a wide range of different models that often share a common base and vary on some parts. On the one hand, some current approaches tend to distinguish the variability language from the DSMLs themselves, implying greater learning curve for DSMLs stakeholders and a significant overhead in product line engineering. On the other hand, approaches integrating variability in DSMLs lack generality and tool support. We argue that aspect-oriented modeling techniques enabling flexible metamodel composition and results obtained by the software product line community to manage and resolve variability form the pillars for a solution for integrating variability into DSMLs. In this article, we consider variability as an independent and generic aspect to be woven into the DSML. In particular, we detail how variability is woven and how to perform product line derivation. We validate our approach through the weaving of variability into two different metamodels: Ecore-widely used for DSML definition-and SmartAdapters, our aspect model weaver. These results emphasize how new abilities of the language can be provided by this means. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Software product line engineering pursues the efficient development of families of similar products. COPLIMO is an economic model that relies on COCOMO II to estimate the benefits of adopting a product line approach compared to developing the products one by one. Although COPLIMO is an ideal economic model to support decision making on the incremental development of a product line, it makes some simplifying assumptions that may produce high distortions in the estimates (e.g.; COPLIMO takes for granted that all the products have the same size). This paper proposes a COPLIMO reformulation that avoids such assumptions and, consequently, improves the accuracy of the estimates. To support our proposal, we present an algorithm that infers the additional information that our COPLIMO reformulation requires from feature diagrams, which is a widespread notation to model the domain of a product line. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Software product line engineering seeks to systematise reuse when developing families of similar software systems so as to minimise development time, cost and defects. To realise variability at the code level, product line methods classically advocate usage of inheritance, components, frameworks, aspects or generative techniques. However, these might require unaffordable paradigm shifts for developers if the software was not thought at the outset as a product line. Furthermore, these techniques can be conflicting with a company's coding practices or external regulations. These concerns were the motivation for the industry-university collaboration described in this paper in which we developed a minimally intrusive coding technique based on tags. The approach was complemented with traceability from code to feature diagrams which were exploited for automated configuration. It is supported by a toolchain and is now in use in the partner company for the development of flight-grade satellite communication software libraries. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={For the development of variable systems, software product lines (SPL) are an established way to handle the variability by using feature models. Nevertheless, the configuration of an SPL can be complex, especially if a product line consists of a large number of features. The problem of handling the complexity becomes even more sophisticated if not only software, but also mechatronic systems containing software and hardware components are configured. Besides modeling the software, within a mechatronic system dependencies and associations between software and hardware features need to be considered which further increases the complexity. To handle this complexity in product lines for mechatronic systems, we propose a multi product line (MPL) approach which allows to distinguish between software and hardware by using different feature models for each. In addition we introduce a level of abstraction to complex product lines consisting of multiple feature models by establishing a feature model mapping. In this paper we present details to the mapping to provide an abstract configuration view as well as the introduced associations for our MPL approach. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Software product line (SPL) techniques handle the construction of customized systems. One of the most common representations of the decisions a customer can make in SPLs is feature models (FMs). An FM represents the relationships among common and variable features in an SPL. Features are a representation of the characteristics in a system that are relevant to customers. FMs are subject to change since the set of features and their relationships can change along an SPL lifecycle. Due to this evolution, the consistency of FMs may be compromised. There exist some approaches to detect and explain inconsistencies in FMs, however this process can take a long time for large FMs. In this paper we present a complementary approach to dealing with inconsistencies in FM evolution scenarios that improves the performance for existing approaches reducing the impact of change to the smallest part of an FM that changes. To achieve our goal, we formalize FMs from an ontological perspective and define constraints that must be satisfied in FMs to be consistent. We define a set of primitive operations that modify FMs and which are responsible for the FM evolution, analyzing their impact on the FM consistency. We propose a set of predefined strategies to keep the consistency for error-prone operations. As a proof-of-concept we present the results of our experiments, where we check for the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach in FMs with thousands of features. Although our approach is limited by the kinds of consistency constraints and the primitive operations we define, the experiments present a significant improvement in performance results in those cases where they are applicable. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Drawing from an analogy between features based Product Line (PL) models and Constraint Programming (CP), this paper explores the use of CP in the Domain Engineering and Application Engineering activities that are put in motion in a Product Line Engineering strategy. Specifying a PL as a constraint program instead of a feature model carries out two important qualities of CP: expressiveness and direct automation. On the one hand, variables in CP can take values over boolean, integer, real or even complex domains and not only boolean values as in most PL languages such as the Feature-Oriented Domain Analysis (FODA). Specifying boolean, arithmetic, symbolic and reified constraint, provides a power of expression that spans beyond that provided by the boolean dependencies in FODA models. On the other hand, PL models expressed as constraint programs can directly be executed and analyzed by off-the-shelf solvers. This paper explores the issues of (a) how to specify a PL model using CP, including in the presence of multi-model representation, (b) how to verify PL specifications, (c) how to specify configuration requirements, and (d) how to support the product configuration activity. Tests performed on a benchmark of 50 PL models show that the approach is efficient and scales up easily to very large and complex PL specifications. Copyright © 2012, IGI Global.},

abstract={Software product lines rely on developing reusable artifacts and defining their variability in models to support and accelerate the derivation of individual products. A major challenge in product lines is the continuous evolution of both the reusable artifacts and derived products. Products that have been derived from a product line have to be updated regularly, e. g., after bugfixes or the development of new features. Changes to reusable artifacts and variability models have to be propagated to derived products. The aim of our research is to provide automated support for the evolution of products derived from product lines by capturing and replaying configuration decisions. Our PUPLE (Product Updates in Product Line Engineering) approach supports updating derived products after changes to the product line they have been derived from. It exploits the structure of variability models and uses change-tracking data to minimize user intervention. The paper first explores how different types of product line changes influence the derived products. It then presents extensions to our decision-oriented product line approach DOPLER to support product line evolution. We evaluate the feasibility of the PUPLE approach with evolution tasks that were performed by engineers of an industry partner on a product line of an Eclipse-based tool suite with six derived products. We conclude with lessons learned and limitations of our approach. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Recent years have witnessed a convergence between research in SPL and Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) that leverages the complementary capabilities that both paradigms can offer. A crucial factor for the success of MDE is the availability of effective support for detecting and fixing inconsistencies among model elements. The importance of such support is attested by the extensive literature devoted to the topic. However, when coupled with variability, the research focus has been devoted to inconsistency detection, while leaving the important issue of fixing the inconsistency largely unaddressed. In this research-in-progress paper, we explore one of the issues that variability raises for inconsistency fixing. Namely, in which features to locate the fixes. We compute what is the minimal number of fixes and use it as a baseline to compare fixes obtained with a heuristic based on feature model analysis and random approaches. Our work highlights the pros and cons of both approaches and suggests how they could be addressed. Copyright 2012 ACM.},

abstract={A widespread business model in cloud computing is to offer software as a service (SaaS) over the Internet. Such applications are often multi-tenant aware, which means that multiple tenants share hardware and software resources of the same application instance. However, SaaS stakeholders have different or even contradictious requirements and interests: For a user, the application's quality and non-functional properties have to be maximized (e.g., choosing the fastest available algorithm for a computation at runtime). In contrast, a resource or application provider is interested in minimizing the operating costs while maximizing his profit. Finally, tenants are interested in offering a customized functionality to their users. To identify an optimal compromise for all these objectives, multiple levels of variability have to be supported by reference architectures for multi-tenant SaaS applications. In this paper, we identify requirements for such a runtime architecture addressing the individual interests of all involved stakeholders. Furthermore, we show how our existing architecture for dynamically adaptive applications can be extended for the development and operation of multi-tenant applications. Copyright 2012 ACM.},

We previously envisioned a way of allowing inconsistencies during product configuration and in this paper we present a solution on how to realize this vision. We introduce HUMUS (High-level Union of Minimal Unsatisfiable Sets), which enables correct reasoning in product line engineering (encoded in SAT) despite the presence of errors. We focus mainly on tolerating inconsistencies during product configuration, to make it possible to resolve inconsistencies later without misguiding the human user along the way. We also provide a discussion of other applications in product line engineering and beyond. The main advantage of using HUMUS is, that it is possible to isolate erroneous parts of a product line model such that existing automations continue to be useful. The applications of HUMUS are thus likely beyond product line engineering. Copyright 2012 ACM.},

abstract={In software product lines, feature models are the de-facto standard for representing variability as well as for configuring products. Yet, configuration relying on feature models faces two issues: i) it assumes knowledge of the underlying formalism, which may not be true for end users and ii) it does not take advantage of advanced user-interface controls, leading to usability and integration problems with other parts of the user interface. To address these issues, our research focuses on the generation of configuration interfaces based on variability models, both from the visual and behavioral perspectives. We tackle visual issues by generating abstract user-interfaces from feature models. Regarding configuration behavior, in particular the configuration sequence, we plan to use feature configuration workows, variability-aware models that exhibit similar characteristics as of task, user, discourse and business models found in the in the human-computer interaction community. This paper discusses the main challenges and possible solutions to realize our vision. Copyright 2012 ACM.},

abstract={In product line engineering, domain analysis is the process of analyzing related products to identify their common and variable features. This process is generally carried out by experts on the basis of existing product descriptions, which are expressed in a more or less structured way. Modeling and reasoning about product descriptions are error-prone and time consuming tasks. Feature models (FMs) constitute popular means to specify product commonalities and variabilities in a compact way, and to provide automated support to the domain analysis process. This paper aims at easing the transition from product descriptions expressed in a tabular format to FMs accurately representing them. This process is parameterized through a dedicated language and high-level directives (e.g., products/features scoping). We guarantee that the resulting FM represents the set of legal feature combinations supported by the considered products and has a readable tree hierarchy together with variability information. We report on our experiments based on public data and characterize the properties of the derived FMs. Copyright 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Variability modeling is essential for defining and managing the commonalities and variabilities in software product lines. Numerous variability modeling approaches exist today to support domain and application engineering activities. Most are based on feature modeling (FM) or decision modeling (DM), but so far no systematic comparison exists between these two classes of approaches. Over the last two decades many new features have been added to both FM and DM and it is tough to decide which approach to use for what purpose. This paper clarifies the relation between FM and DM. We aim to systematize the research field of variability modeling and to explore potential synergies. We compare multiple aspects of FM and DM ranging from historical origins and rationale, through syntactic and semantic richness, to tool support, identifying commonalities and differences. We hope that this effort will improve the understanding of the range of approaches to variability modeling by discussing the possible variations. This will provide insights to users considering adopting variability modeling in practice and to designers of new languages, such as the new OMG Common Variability Language. Copyright 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Features are pieces of core functionality of a program that is relevant to particular stakeholders. Features pose dependencies and constraints among each other. These dependencies and constraints describe the possible number of variants of the program: A valid feature configuration generates a specific variant with unique behavior. Feature-Oriented Programming is used to implement features as program units. This paper introduces rbFeatures, a feature-oriented programming language implemented on top of the dynamic programming language Ruby. With rbFeatures, programmers use software product lines, variants, and features as first-class entities. This allows several runtime reflection and modification capabilities, including the extension of the product line with new features and the provision of multiple variants. The paper gives a broad overview to the implementation and application of rbFeatures. We explain how features as first-class entities are designed and implemented, and discuss how the semantics of features are carefully added to Ruby programs. We show two case studies: The expression product line, a common example in feature-oriented programming, and a web application. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This paper presents an innovative system architecture development framework that allows the search of optimum architecture solutions within large design space by automating certain model construction, alternative generation, simulation, and assessment tasks. Such framework is facilitated by a holistic modeling approach that combines the capabilities of Object Process Methodology (OPM), Colored Petri Net (CPN) and feature model. The resultant holistic model not only can capture the structural, behavior, and dynamic aspects of a system, allowing strong analysis methods to be applied, but also can specify the architectural design space allowing generation of architecture alternatives that cover it. The proposed framework and suggested implementation is generic targeted at systems that can be specified by logic models using object-oriented paradigm. A partial implementation of the proposed approaches is presented with the design of reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMSs) as an example, which is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem with the Genetic Algorithm (GA, particularly, NSGA-2) as the search algorithm. The RMS is a multi-part flow line structure with identical machines in each production stage. © 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={For more than 30 years, knowledge-based product configuration systems have been successfully applied in many industrial domains. Correspondingly, a large number of advanced techniques and algorithms have been developed in academia and industry to support different aspects of configuration reasoning. While traditional research in the field focused on the configuration of physical artefacts, recognition of the business value of customizable software products led to the emergence of software product line engineering. Despite the significant overlap in research interests, the two fields mainly evolved in isolation. Only limited attempts were made at combining the approaches developed in the different fields. In this paper, we first aim to give an overview of commonalities and differences between software product line engineering and product configuration. We then identify opportunities for cross-fertilization between these fields and finally develop a research agenda to combine their respective techniques.

abstract={Context: Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) has emerged as a thriving approach for software products constructions. In SPLE, a triumphant software product is highly reliant on the validity of an SPLE. Hence, validation is a significant process within SPLE. Objective: In this paper, we reviewed the related works in the area of automated validation of SPLE to bring to light the pros and cons of the related works and suggest the future directions in this research area. Method: We started by defining the validation operations followed by classification of the related works in eight groups based on the technique or method that is used. The general attributes of each class are highlighted and the main strengths and weaknesses of each class related to the validation of SPLE are thrashed out. Subsequently, we analyzed each work to find out which validation operations are achieved and how they are satisfied. Finally, we abridged the current situation and recommended how the validation of SPLE can be enhanced in each operation. Results: The research gap in the area of validation of SPLE has been clarified by recommending the future directions. Conclusion: It is concluded that some works cannot gratify all the validation operations because the technique or method used has its weaknesses that prevented the completion of the validation process. Moreover, we conclude that this area of research has room for improvement by validating the domain-engineering directly instead of validating software products during the configuration process. © 2005-2012 JATIT & LLS.},

In the context of an SPL composed of features including variability, the proposed method relates every feature configuration (evaluation of the configuration parameters) at the design level with a feature instantiation at the requirement level. The core step in the method is a conformance checking procedure that is based upon the well-known automata containment algorithm used in formal verification of finite state systems. The method has been implemented on top of the well-known verification tool, SPIN, and then experimented on an industrial example with encouraging results. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Successful software is more and more rarely developed as a one-of-a-kind system. Instead, different system variants are built from a common set of assets and customized for catering to the different functionality or technology needs of the distinct clients and users. The Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) paradigm has proven effective to cope with the variability described for this scenario. However, evolving a Software Product Line (SPL) from a family of systems is not a simple endeavor. A crucial requirement is accurately capturing the variability present in the family of systems and representing it with Feature Models (FMs), the de facto standard for variability modeling. Current research has focused on extracting FMs from configuration scripts, propositional logic expressions or natural language. In contrast, in this short paper we present an algorithm that reverse engineers a basic feature model from the feature sets which describe the features each system provides. We perform an evaluation of our approach using several case studies and outline the issues that still need to be addressed. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Today many software systems are developed for a wide even anonymous audience. If needs of customers are too diverse, offering one software product can be too inflexible. In that situation offering a Software Product Line (SPL) can be economically advantageous. However, product management of SPLs has to decide what features to realize. This decision requires information on the utility features spend to customers and customer's willingness to pay (WTP). Conjoint Analysis (CA) is a promising way to measure both. However, the design and implementation of a conjoint study is costly even though much of the work to design a conjoint study has already been done in Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE). To utilize the work of SPLE for the design of conjoint surveys, we propose a procedure to automatically derive conjoint surveys from Feature Models and report on our implementation of a conjoint survey generator and a web-based surveying tool. © 2011 IEEE.},

In particular, while most research on design for software focuses on finding some correct solution, this ignores that such a solution is often only correct in a particular, and often short-lived, context. Using a logic-based goal-oriented requirements modeling language, the paper poses the problem of finding desirable solutions as the requirements change. Among other possible criteria of desirability, we consider minimizing the effort required to implement the new solution, which involves reusing parts of the old solution. In general, the solution of requirements problems is viewed as an exploration using a "requirements engineering knowledge base" (REKB), whose specification is formalized. The paper reports on experience implementing the REKB on top of a so-called "reason-maintenance system", and provides evidence that incremental solution finding is indeed more efficient. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Product line models are important artefacts in product line engineering. One of the most popular languages to model the variability of a product line is the feature notation. Since the initial proposal of feature models in 1990, the notation has evolved in different aspects. One of the most important improvements allows specify the number of instances that a feature can have in a particular product. This improvement implies an important increase on the number of variables needed to represent a feature model. Another improvement consists in allowing features to have attributes, which can take values on a different domain than the boolean one. These two extensions have increased the complexity of feature models and therefore have made more difficult the manually or even automated reasoning on feature models. To the best of our knowledge, very few works exist in literature to address this problem. In this paper we show that reasoning on extended feature models is easy and scalable by using constraint programming over integer domains. The aim of the paper is double (a) to show the rules for transforming extended feature models into constraint programs, and (b) to demonstrate, by means of 11 reasoning operations over feature models, the usefulness and benefits of our approach. We evaluated our approach by transforming 60 feature models of sizes up to 2000 features and by comparing it with 2 other approaches available in the literature. The evaluation showed that our approach is correct, useful and scalable to industry size models.},

In SPLs, commonality and variability of a system family are identified and often documented in a feature model. However, the development of a feature model for mobile and context-aware SPLs is not trivial, since it should comprise system and context information. Furthermore, the consistency check of feature models in the considered domain is also complex and demands advanced skills of software engineers.

abstract={In the scientific community, feature models are the de-facto standard for representing variability in software product line engineering. This is different from industrial settings where they appear to be used much less frequently. We and other authors found that in a number of cases, they lack concision, naturalness and expressiveness. This is confirmed by industrial experience. When modelling variability, an efficient tool for making models intuitive and concise are feature attributes. Yet, the semantics of feature models with attributes is not well understood and most existing notations do not support them at all. Furthermore, the graphical nature of feature models' syntax also appears to be a barrier to industrial adoption, both psychological and rational. Existing tool support for graphical feature models is lacking or inadequate, and inferior in many regards to tool support for text-based formats. To overcome these shortcomings, we designed TVL, a text-based feature modelling language. In terms of expressiveness, TVL subsumes most existing dialects. The main goal of designing TVL was to provide engineers with a human-readable language with a rich syntax to make modelling easy and models natural, but also with a formal semantics to avoid ambiguity and allow powerful automation. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Feature models are commonly used to specify variability in software product lines. Several tools support feature models for variability management at different steps in the development process. However, tool support for test configuration generation is currently limited. This test generation task consists in systematically selecting a set of configurations that represent a relevant sample of the variability space and that can be used to test the product line. In this paper we propose PACOGEN to analyze feature models and automatically generate a set of configurations that cover all pair wise interactions between features. PACOGEN relies on constraint programming to generate configurations that satisfy all constraints imposed by the feature model and to minimize the set of the tests configurations. This work also proposes an extensive experiment, based on the state-of-the art SPLOT feature models repository, showing that PACOGEN scales over variability spaces with millions of configurations and covers pair wise with less configurations than other available tools. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={With the recent smartphone boom, plenty of mobile phone platforms have emerged which complement simpler platforms that existed before. At the same time, mobile phones today are capable of things that were hardly imaginable a few years ago. This enables new type of applications. From an application developers view, it is challenging to keep up with the latest developments though. The close relation between application features and platform components that realize that feature, is increasingly hard to track. For instance, the requirement to provide SMS functionality requires at least certain input- and output functionalities, and a wireless transmission technology such as GSM or WCDMA. This work in progress elaborates on this situation and - -once completed - -provides support at studying the consequences of selecting certain application features on the required platform components (hardware and/or software), and vice versa. It helps to understand what application features and platform components are required to realize a certain application. Vice versa, from a bottom up view it can analyze what features will be supported by a certain platform. The position paper proposes to use two-layered feature models to differentiate between application functionality and platform components, and suggests a mapping that enables the analysis of feature interaction (i.e., the interrelation of features on other features or components). Future work will then be able to utilize the models for automated analysis. © 2011 ACM.},

However, most of the existing methods for the automated analysis of feature models are not devised to handle such models. In this paper we define a transformation to remove such cross-tree relations, which is applicable when certain restrictions hold. This transformation takes an extended feature model with cross-tree relations involving attributes and constructs a semantically equivalent model that includes only basic cross-tree constraints. Those models with the restricted form of cross-tree relations are allowed to have feature attributes with continuous domains. Thus, the proposed transformation enables automated analysis on an equivalent model without facing extra challenges introduced by the inclusion of attributes in cross-tree relations. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Software product line (SPL) engineering is a cost-effective approach to developing families of similar products. Key to the success of this approach is to correctly scope the domain of the SPL, identifying the common and variable features of the products and the interdependencies between features. In this study, the authors show how the commonality of a feature (i.e. the reuse ratio of the feature among the products) can be used to detect scope flaws in the early stages of development. SPL domains are usually modelled by means of feature diagrams following the feature-oriented domain analysis (FODA) notation. The authors extend classical FODA trees with unrestricted cardinalities, and present an algorithm to compute the number of products modelled by a feature diagram and the commonality of the features. Finally, the authors compare the performance of their algorithm with two other approaches built on top of boolean logic satisfiability (SAT)-solver technology such as cachet and relsat. © 2011 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.},

abstract={The formalization of variability models (e.g. feature models) is a prerequisite for the automated analysis of these models. The efficient execution of the analysis operations depends on the selection of well-suited solver implementations. Regarding feature models, on the one hand, the formalization with Boolean expressions enables the use of SAT or BDD solvers. On the other hand, feature models can be transformed into a Constraint-Satisfaction Problem (CSP) in order to use CSP solvers for validation. This paper presents a performance comparison regarding nine contemporary high-performance solvers, three for each base problem structure (BDD, CSP, and SAT). Four operations on 90 feature models are run on each solver. The results will in turn clear the way for new improvements regarding the automatic verification of software product lines, since the efficient execution of analysis operations is essential to such automatic verification approaches. © 2011 IEEE.},

While related work has been able to capture variability and variability dependencies within a composition, these approaches fail to capture variability dependenciesbetween the composition and partner services. Consequently, these approaches cannot address the situation when a composite service is orchestrated from partner services some of which are customizable. In this paper, we propose a feature-based approach that is able to effectively model variability within and across compositions. The approach is supported by a process development methodology that enables the systematic reuse and management of variability. We develop a prototype system supporting extended BPMN 2.0 to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={In many projects, lexical preprocessors are used to manage different variants of the project (using conditional compilation) and to define compile-time code transformations (using macros). Unfortunately, while being a simple way to implement variability, conditional compilation and lexical macros hinder automatic analysis, even though such analysis is urgently needed to combat variability-induced complexity. To analyze code with its variability, we need to parse it without preprocessing it. However, current parsing solutions use unsound heuristics, support only a subset of the language, or suffer from exponential explosion. As part of the TypeChef project, we contribute a novel variability-aware parser that can parse almost all unpreprocessed code without heuristics in practicable time. Beyond the obvious task of detecting syntax errors, our parser paves the road for further analysis, such as variability-aware type checking. We implement variability-aware parsers for Java and GNU C and demonstrate practicability by parsing the product line MobileMedia and the entire X86 architecture of the Linux kernel with 6065 variable features.

abstract={Decision-making is central to Software Product Management (SPM) and includes deciding on requirements priorities and the content of coming releases. Several algorithms for prioritization and release planning have been proposed, where humans with or without machine support enact a series of steps to produce a decision outcome. Instead of applying some specific algorithm to find an acceptable solution to a decision problem, we propose to model SPM decision-making as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP), where relative and absolute priorities, interdependencies, and other constraints are expressed as relations among variables representing entities such as feature priorities, stakeholder preferences, and resource constraints. The solution space is then explored with the help of a constraint solver without humans needing to care about specific algorithms. This paper discusses advantages and limitations of CSP modeling in SPM and gives principal examples as a proof-of-concept of CSP modeling in requirements prioritization and release planning. A discussion of further research on constraint solving in SPM is also given. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={In industrial settings, products are rarely developed by one organization alone. Software vendors and suppliers typically maintain their own product lines, which can contribute to a larger (multi) product line. The teams involved often use different approaches and tools to manage the variability of their systems. It is unrealistic to assume that all participating units can use a standardized and prescribed variability modeling technique. The configuration of products based on several models in different notations and with different semantics is not well supported by existing approaches. In this paper we present an integrative approach that provides a unified perspective to users configuring products in multi product line environments, regardless of the different modeling methods and tools used internally. We also present a technical infrastructure and a prototypic implementation based on Web Services. We show the feasibility of the approach and its implementation by using it with two different variability modeling approaches (one feature-based and one decision-oriented approach) on an example derived from industrial experience. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={A software product line is a set of program variants, typically generated from a common code base. Feature models describe variability in product lines by documenting features and their valid combinations. In product-line engineering, we need to reason about variability and program variants for many different tasks. For example, given a feature model, we might want to determine the number of all valid feature combinations or compute specific feature combinations for testing. However, we found that contemporary reasoning approaches can only reason about feature combinations, not about program variants, because they do not take abstract features into account. Abstract features are features used to structure a feature model that, however, do not have any impact at implementation level. Using existing feature-model reasoning mechanisms for program variants leads to incorrect results. Hence, although abstract features represent domain decisions that do not affect the generation of a program variant. We raise awareness of the problem of abstract features for different kinds of analyses on feature models. We argue that, in order to reason about program variants, abstract features should be made explicit in feature models. We present a technique based on propositional formulas that enables to reason about program variants rather than feature combinations. In practice, our technique can save effort that is caused by considering the same program variant multiple times, for example, in product-line testing. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Feature modeling is widely used in software product-line engineering to capture the commonalities and variabilities within an application domain. As feature models evolve, they can become very complex with respect to the number of features and the dependencies among them, which can cause the product derivation based on feature selection to become quite time consuming and error prone. We address this problem by presenting techniques to find good feature selection sequences that are based on the number of products that contain a particular feature and the impact of a selected feature on the selection of other features. Specifically, we identify a feature selection strategy, which brings up highly selective features early for selection. By prioritizing feature selection based on the selectivity of features our technique makes the feature selection process more efficient. Moreover, our approach helps with the problem of unexpected side effects of feature selection in later stages of the selection process, which is commonly considered a difficult problem. We have run our algorithm on the e-Shop and Berkeley DB feature models and also on some automatically generated feature models. The evaluation results demonstrate that our techniques can shorten the product derivation processes significantly. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={More and more frequently successful software systems need to evolve into families of systems, known as Software Product Lines (SPLs), to be able to cater to the different functionality requirements demanded by different customers while at the same time aiming to exploit as much common functionality as possible. As a first step, this evolution demands a clear understanding of how the functional requirements map into the features of the original system. Using this knowledge, features can be refactored so that they are reused for building the new systems of the evolved SPL. In this paper we present our experience in refactoring features based on the requirements specifications of a small and a medium size systems. Our work identified eight refactoring patterns that describe how to extract the elements of features which were subsequently implemented using Feature Oriented Software Development (FOSD) a novel modularization paradigm whose driving goal is to effectively modularize features for the development of variable systems. We argue that the identification of refactoring patterns are a stepping stone towards automating Feature-Oriented Refactoring, and present some open issues that should be addressed to that avail. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Context: The increasing presence of Object-Oriented (OO) programs in industrial systems is progressively drawing the attention of mutation researchers toward this paradigm. However, while the number of research contributions in this topic is plentiful, the number of empirical results is still marginal and mostly provided by researchers rather than practitioners. Objective: This article reports our experience using mutation testing to measure the effectiveness of an automated test data generator from a user perspective. Method: In our study, we applied both traditional and class-level mutation operators to FaMa, an open source Java framework currently being used for research and commercial purposes. We also compared and contrasted our results with the data obtained from some motivating faults found in the literature and two real tools for the analysis of feature models, FaMa and SPLOT. Results: Our results are summarized in a number of lessons learned supporting previous isolated results as well as new findings that hopefully will motivate further research in the field. Conclusion: We conclude that mutation testing is an effective and affordable technique to measure the effectiveness of test mechanisms in OO systems. We found, however, several practical limitations in current tool support that should be addressed to facilitate the work of testers. We also missed specific techniques and tools to apply mutation testing at the system level. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In many projects, lexical preprocessors are used to manage different variants of the project (using conditional compilation) and to define compile-time code transformations (using macros). Unfortunately, while being a simple way to implement variability, conditional compilation and lexical macros hinder automatic analysis, even though such analysis is urgently needed to combat variability-induced complexity. To analyze code with its variability, we need to parse it without preprocessing it. However, current parsing solutions use unsound heuristics, support only a subset of the language, or suffer from exponential explosion. As part of the TypeChef project, we contribute a novel variability-aware parser that can parse almost all unpreprocessed code without heuristics in practicable time. Beyond the obvious task of detecting syntax errors, our parser paves the road for further analysis, such as variability-aware type checking. We implement variability-aware parsers for Java and GNU C and demonstrate practicability by parsing the product line MobileMedia and the entire X86 architecture of the Linux kernel with 6065 variable features.

abstract={Reverse engineering the variability of an existing system is a challenging activity. The architect knowledge is essential to identify variation points and explicit constraints between features, for instance in feature models (FMs), but the manual creation of FMs is both time-consuming and error-prone. On a large scale, it is very difficult for an architect to guarantee that the resulting FM is consistent with the architecture it is associated with. In this paper, we present a comprehensive, tool supported process for reverse engineering architectural FMs. We develop automated techniques to extract and combine different variability descriptions of an architecture. Then, alignment and reasoning techniques are applied to integrate the architect knowledge and reinforce the extracted FM. We illustrate the process when applied to a representative software system and we report on our experience in this context. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Embodied Ubiquitous Learning Games (UELG) represent a new genre of technology-enhanced education in which learners interact with augmented physical environment to learn. The embodiment in such games comes from instrumented clothes based on e-Textiles incorporating sensors, actuators and low-power wireless modules. Designing and building such ubiquitous systems requires a complex interplay of conventional and embedded hardware and software co-design that includes novel elements like e-Textiles. In order to reduce the cost and shorten the development life-cycle this paper proposes the use of Software Product Lines (SPL). Towards this end, this paper borrows ideas from Architecture to present and apply a framework for constructing feature models for a Software Product Line for ULEG. The framework explicitly uses different types of features related to pedagogy, technology and domain of learning. A family of UELG based on a combination of problem posing and problem solving is used as an example to explain various components of the framework. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

The functional requirements of the target product can be satisfied by including the proper functional features. However, there is no such a straightforward way to realize the non-functional requirements and quality attributes of the target product. In our early work, we have developed a quantitative based method to assess the quality attributes for a configured product. However, this approach cannot adequately represent the inter-relationships among quality attributes which play an important role in product configuration process. We supplement our previous work by introducing a quality attribute knowledge base (QA-KB) to represent the inter-relationships among different quality attributes in a SPL. Furthermore, we develop algorithms for configuring a product based on customers'quality requirements. We also use a case study to illustrate our approach. Copyright © 2011 ACM.},

We present the non-Boolean aspects of 116 variability models available in the codebase of eCos-a real time embedded operating system. We characterize the types of non- Boolean features in the models, kinds and quantities of non- Boolean constraints in use, and the impact of these characteristics on the hardness of this model from analysis perspective.

In particular, we address the matching of one required against several provided specifications, distinguishing between static matching, where all services are known in advance, and dynamic matching, where one provided service is matched at a time.

There are many visualization techniques described in the literature - e.g., in Software Visualization - and some isolated techniques have been applied in PLE tools. Nevertheless, the full potential of visualization in the context of PLE has not been exploited so far.

This paper presents a modeling process in which variability sources are separated in different FMs and inter-related by propositional constraints while consistency checking and propagation of variability choices are automated. We show how the variability requirements can be expressed and then refined at design time so that the set of valid software configurations to be considered at runtime may be highly reduced.

We evaluate the technique on two large-scale software product lines with existing reference feature models - the Linux and eCos kernels - and FreeBSD, a project without a feature model. Our heuristic is effective across all three projects by ranking the correct parent among the top results for a vast majority of features.

The essence of SPLE is the process of factoring out commonalities and systematizing variabilities, that is, differences, among the products in a SPL. In this talk, I will take the position that this process is the very act of abstraction. Thus, as suggested by Coplien et al. [8], the purpose of abstraction mechanisms, such as subroutines and inheritance in programming languages and architectural patterns and platforms in architectural design, is to support factoring out commonalities and making variabilities explicit. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={A key aspect for effective variability modeling of Software Product Lines (SPL) is to harmonize the need to achieve separation of concerns with the need to satisfy consistency of requirements and constraints. Techniques for variability modeling such as feature models used together with use scenarios help to achieve separation of stakeholders' concerns but ensuring their joint consistency is largely unsupported. Therefore, inconsistent assumptions about system's expected use scenarios and the way in which they vary according to the presence or absence of features reduce the models usefulness and possibly renders invalid SPL systems. In this paper we propose an approach to check consistency - the verification of semantic relationships among the models - between features and use scenarios that realize them. The novelty of this approach is that it is specially tailored for the SPL domain and considers complex composition situations where the customization of use scenarios for specific products depends on the presence or absence of sets of features. We illustrate our approach and supporting tools using variant constructs that specify how the inclusion of sets of variable features (that refer to uncommon requirements between products of a SPL) adapt use scenarios related to other features. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Increasingly, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) is becoming a dominant mechanism for the consumption of software by end users. From a vendor's perspective, the benefits of SaaS arise from leveraging economies of scale, by serving a large number of customers ("tenants") through a shared instance of a centrally hosted software service. Consequently, a SaaS provider would, in general, try to drive commonality amongst the requirements of different tenants, and at best, offer a fixed set of customization options. However, many tenants would also come with custom requirements, which may be a pre-requisite for them to adopt the SaaS system. These requirements should then be addressed by evolving the SaaS system in a controlled manner, while still supporting the needs of existing tenants. This need to balance tenant variability and commonality, and to optimize on development and testing effort, can make the evolution of multi-tenant SaaS systems an interesting engineering challenge; this has strong economic undertones as well, given the "pay-per-use" subscription model of SaaS, and the cost of incremental development and maintenance to cater to new tenant needs. In this paper, we outline a set of research issues in the design, testing and maintenance of multi-tenant SaaS systems, and highlight some of the interesting optimization questions that arise in the process. Presenting specific technical solutions is beyond the scope of this paper - instead, our goal is to help shape a research agenda for multi-tenant SaaS that can provide stimulus for further investigation into this area by the software and service engineering research community. © 2011 ACM.},

abstract={Software Product Lines (SPLs) have emerged as a prominent approach for software reuse. SPLs are sets of software systems called families that are usually developed as a whole and share many common features. Feature models are most typically used as a means for capturing commonality and managing variability of the family. A particular product from the family is configured by selecting the desired features of that product. Typically, feature models are considered monolithic entities that do not support modularization well. As industrial feature models tend to be large, their modularization has become an important research topic lately. However, existing modularization approaches do not support modularization of crosscutting concerns. In this paper, we introduce Aspect-oriented Feature Models (AoFM) and argue that using aspect-oriented techniques improves the manageability and reduces the maintainability effort of feature models. Particularly, we advocate an asymmetric approach that allows for the modularization of basic and crosscutting concerns in feature models. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

However, feature models may become too large easily, which complicates the management of the model. One of the reasons of complexity arises from the constraints imposed by the context on the product family. In this article we propose a strategy that uses context information for performing staged configurations on feature models. We introduce an organization structure for the context variability model and use this organization to determine the configurations for specification stages. This approach enables the elimination of context-related variability from the feature model, thus results in a reduction in the complexity of the model and enables to focus on the functional features of the product family.},

abstract={A feature model (FM) defines the valid combinations of features, whose combinations correspond to a program in a Software Product Line (SPL). FMs may evolve, for instance, during refactoring activities. Developers may use a catalog of refactorings as support. However, the catalog is incomplete in principle. Additionally, it is non-trivial to propose correct refactorings. To our knowledge, no previous analysis technique for FMs is used for checking properties of general FM refactorings (a transformation that can be applied to a number of FMs) containing a representative number of features. We propose an efficient encoding of FMs in the Alloy formal specification language. Based on this encoding, we show how the Alloy Analyzer tool, which performs analysis on Alloy models, can be used to automatically check whether encoded general and specific FM refactorings are correct. Our approach can analyze general transformations automatically to a significant scale in a few seconds. In order to evaluate the analysis performance of our encoding, we evaluated in automatically generated FMs ranging from 500 to 2,000 features. Furthermore, we analyze the soundness of general transformations. © J.UCS.},

abstract={The embedded systems market and especially the software part of it is growing drastically in automotive industry. Today we see that the value of software or functionality that is realized using software within cars is about 35% of the value of the car itself. We have typically more than 70 embedded control units (ECUs) in a car with functionality realized and controlled by software. The standardization of communication interfaces and operating system functionality as for example realized by AUTOSAR facilitates the distributed development of software. But the needs to produce software in time and in budget remain still a main task in automotive software industry. To cope with tight project plans, process models based on product line technology promise a good chance to be successful. Nevertheless, the need to control the product development remains still one of the most important questions in this area. The work presented here gives some new insights into the definition and application of measures with special emphasis on the variability aspects used within a product line development. Several known techniques as for example atomic sets or formal variability analysis are revisited and used within the context of variability metrics. The measures are categorized and can be used within a project to control and manage the defined variability. Copyright 2011 ACM.},

abstract={It has been shown that product line engineering can significantly improve the productivity, quality and time-to-market of software development by leveraging extensive reuse. Variability models are currently the most advanced approach to define, document and manage the commonalities and variabilities of reusable artifacts such as software components, requirements, test cases, etc. These models provide the basis for automating the derivation of new products and are thus the key artifact to leverage the flexibility and adaptability of systems in a product line. Among the existing approaches to variability modeling feature modeling and decision modeling have gained most importance. A significant amount of research exists on comparing and analyzing different feature modeling approaches. However, despite their significant role in product line research and practical applications, only little effort has been devoted to compare and analyze decision modeling approaches. In order to address this shortcoming and to provide a basis for more structured research on decision modeling in the future, we present a comparative analysis of representative approaches. We identify their major modeling concepts and present an analysis of their commonalities and variabilities. Copyright 2011 ACM.},

abstract={Context: A feature model (FM) represents the valid combinations of features in a domain. The automated extraction of information from FMs is a complex task that involves numerous analysis operations, techniques and tools. Current testing methods in this context are manual and rely on the ability of the tester to decide whether the output of an analysis is correct. However, this is acknowledged to be time-consuming, error-prone and in most cases infeasible due to the combinatorial complexity of the analyses, this is known as the oracle problem. Objective: In this paper, we propose using metamorphic testing to automate the generation of test data for feature model analysis tools overcoming the oracle problem. An automated test data generator is presented and evaluated to show the feasibility of our approach. Method: We present a set of relations (so-called metamorphic relations) between input FMs and the set of products they represent. Based on these relations and given a FM and its known set of products, a set of neighbouring FMs together with their corresponding set of products are automatically generated and used for testing multiple analyses. Complex FMs representing millions of products can be efficiently created by applying this process iteratively. Results: Our evaluation results using mutation testing and real faults reveal that most faults can be automatically detected within a few seconds. Two defects were found in FaMa and another two in SPLOT, two real tools for the automated analysis of feature models. Also, we show how our generator outperforms a related manual suite for the automated analysis of feature models and how this suite can be used to guide the automated generation of test cases obtaining important gains in efficiency. Conclusion: Our results show that the application of metamorphic testing in the domain of automated analysis of feature models is efficient and effective in detecting most faults in a few seconds without the need for a human oracle. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={A feature model is a compact representation of all the products of a software product line. Automated analysis of feature models is rapidly gaining importance: new operations of analysis have been proposed, new tools have been developed to support those operations and different logical paradigms and algorithms have been proposed to perform them. Implementing operations is a complex task that easily leads to errors in analysis solutions. In this context, the lack of specific testing mechanisms is becoming a major obstacle hindering the development of tools and affecting their quality and reliability. In this article, the authors present FaMa test suite, a set of implementation- independent test cases to validate the functionality of feature model analysis tools. This is an efficient and handy mechanism to assist in the development of tools, detecting faults and improving their quality. In order to show the effectiveness of their proposal, the authors evaluated the suite using mutation testing as well as real faults and tools. Their results are promising and directly applicable in the testing of analysis solutions.

Since variability models provide basis for automated tools (feature dependency checkers and product configurators), we believe that our findings will be of interest to variability modeling language and tool designers. © 2010 ACM.},

abstract={The complexity of product line variability models makes it hard to maintain their consistency over time regardless of the modeling approach used. Engineers thus need support for detecting and resolving inconsistencies. We describe experiences of applying a tool-supported approach for incremental consistency checking on variability models. Our approach significantly improves the overall performance and scalability compared to batch-oriented techniques and allows providing immediate feedback to modelers. It is extensible as new consistency constraints can easily be added. Furthermore, the approach is flexible as it is not limited to variability models and it also checks the consistency of the models with the underlying code base of the product line. We report the results of a thorough evaluation based on real-world product line models and discuss lessons learned. © 2010 ACM.},

abstract={The automated analysis of variability models in general and feature models in particular is a thriving research topic. There have been numerous contributions along the last twenty years in this area including both, research papers and tools. However, the lack of realistic variability models to evaluate those techniques and tools is recognized as a major problem by the community. To address this issue, we looked for large-scale variability models in the open source community. We found that the Debian package dependency language can be interpreted as software product line variability model. Moreover, we found that those models can be automatically analysed in a software product line variability model-like style. In this paper, we take a first step towards the automated analysis of Debian package dependency language. We provide a mapping from these models to propositional formulas. We also show how this could allow us to perform analysis operations on the repositories like the detection of anomalies (e.g. packages that cannot be installed).},

abstract={Feature-Oriented Software Development (FOSD) is a paradigm for the development of software product lines. A challenge in FOSD is to guarantee that all software systems of a software product line are correct. Recent work on type checking product lines can provide a guarantee of type correctness without generating all possible systems. We generalize previous results by abstracting from the specifics of particular programming languages. In a first attempt, we present a reference-checking algorithm that performs key tasks of product-line type checking independently of the target programming language. Experiments with two sample product lines written in Java and C are encouraging and give us confidence that this approach is promising. © 2010 ACM.},

abstract={In feature models' construction, one basic task is to ensure the consistency of feature models, which often involves detecting and fixing of inconsistencies in feature models. Several approaches have been proposed to detect inconsistencies, but few focus on the problem of fixing inconsistent feature models. In this paper, we propose a dynamic-priority based approach to fixing inconsistent feature models, with the purpose of helping domain analysts find solutions to inconsistencies efficiently. The basic idea of our approach is to first recommend a solution automatically, then gradually reach the desirable solution by dynamically adjusting priorities of constraints. To this end, we adopt the constraint hierarchy theory to express the degree of domain analysts' confidence on constraints (i.e. the priorities of constraints) and resolve inconsistencies among constraints. Two case studies have been conducted to demonstrate the usability and scalability of our approach. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={As feature models for realistic product families may be quite complicated, automated analysis of feature models is desirable. Although several approaches reported in the literature addressed this issue, complex feature-attribute and attribute-attribute relationships in extended feature models were not handled effectively. In this article, we introduce a mapping from extended feature models to constraint logic programming over finite domains. This mapping is used to translate basic, cardinality-based, and extended feature models, which may include complex feature-feature, feature-attribute and attribute-attribute cross-tree relationships, into constraint logic programs. It thus enables use of off-the-shelf constraint solvers for the automated analysis of extended feature models involving such complex relationships. We also briefly discuss the ramifications of including feature-attribute relationships in operations of analysis. We believe that this proposal will be effective for further leveraging of constraint logic programming for automated analysis of feature models. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={A Software Product Line (SPL) is a family of related software systems distinguished by the different sets of features each system provides. Over the last decade, the substantial benefits of SPL practices have been extensively documented and corroborated both in academia and industry. Several architecture methods have been proposed that employ different artifacts for expressing the components of a SPL, their properties and relationships. Of crucial importance for any SPL architecture method is to guarantee that the variability, for instance as expressed in feature models, is not only preserved but also kept consistent across all artifacts used. In this research challenge paper we argue that Safe Composition - the guarantee that all programs of a product line are type safe - can be leveraged to address this guarantee for structural properties of SPL architectures and the challenges that that entails. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Feature models have been widely adopted to reuse the requirements of a set of similar products in a domain. When constructing feature models, it is difficult to always ensure the consistency of feature models. Therefore, tolerating inconsistencies is important during the construction of feature models. The usual way of tolerating inconsistencies is to find the minimal unsatisfiable core. However, identifying the minimal unsatisfiable core is time-consuming, which decreases itself the practicability. In this paper, we propose a priority based approach to tolerating inconsistencies in feature models efficiently. The basic idea of our approach is to find the weaker unsatisfied constraints, while keeping the rest of the feature model consistent. Our approach tolerates inconsistencies with the help of priority based operations while building feature models. To this end, we adopt the constraint hierarchy theory to express the degree of domain analysts' confidence on constraints (i.e. the priorities of constraints) and tolerate inconsistencies in feature models. Experiments have been conducted to demonstrate that our system can scale up to large feature models.},
